    <p>
      It is with the full consent of the bush-folk that this one year of their
      lives&mdash;the year of 1902&mdash;is given to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em anything you like,&rdquo; they said, one and all,
      unconsciously testifying to their single-heartedness. And in the telling I
      have striven to give that year as I found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every turn the bush-folk have helped me; verifying statements and
      furnishing details required with minute exactness; while I am indebted to
      Mr. W. Holtze, Mr. G. G. Jaensch, &ldquo;Mine Host,&rdquo; and the Quiet
      Stockman for the photographic plates with which this book is illustrated.

    <p>
      We&mdash;are just some of the bush-folk of the Never-Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinct in the foreground stand:
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka, The Little Missus, The Sanguine Scot, The Head Stockman,
      The Dandy, The Quiet Stockman, The Fizzer, Mine Host, The Wag, Some of our
      Guests, A few black &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and lubras, A dog or two, Tam-o&rsquo;-Shanter,
      Happy Dick, Sam Lee, and last, but by no means least, Cheon&mdash;the
      ever-mirthful, ever-helpful, irrepressible Cheon, who was crudely recorded
      on the station books as cook and gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      The background is filled in with an ever-moving company&mdash;a strange
      medley of Whites, Blacks, and Chinese; of travellers, overlanders, and
      billabongers, who passed in and out of our lives, leaving behind them
      sometimes bright memories, sometimes sad, and sometimes little memory at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And All of Us, and many of this company, shared each other&rsquo;s lives
      for one bright, sunny year, away Behind the Back of Beyond, in the Land of
      the Never-Never; in that elusive land with an elusive name&mdash;a land of
      dangers and hardships and privations yet loved as few lands are loved&mdash;a
      land that bewitches her people with strange spells and mysteries, until
      they call sweet bitter, and bitter sweet. Called the Never-Never, the M&#259;luka
      loved to say, because they, who have lived in it and loved it Never-Never
      voluntarily leave it. Sadly enough, there are too many who Never-Never do
      leave it. Others&mdash;the unfitted&mdash;will tell you that it is so
      called because they who succeed in getting out of it swear they will
      Never-Never return to it. But we who have lived in it, and loved it, and
      left it, know that our hearts can Never-Never rest away from it.

    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter1" id="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin somewhere near the beginning, the M&#259;luka&mdash;better known
      at that time as the new Boss for the Elsey&mdash;and I, his &ldquo;missus,&rdquo;
      were at Darwin, in the Northern Territory, waiting for the train that was
      to take us just as far as it could&mdash;one hundred and fifty miles&mdash;on
      our way to the Never-Never. It was out of town just then, up-country
      somewhere, billabonging in true bush-whacker style, but was expected to
      return in a day or two, when it would be at our service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, the Quiet Stockman, was out at the homestead, &ldquo;seeing to
      things&rdquo; there. The Sanguine Scot, the Head Stockman, and the Dandy,
      were in at the Katherine, marking time, as it were, awaiting instructions
      by wire from the M&#259;luka, while some of the Company &ldquo;put
      finishing touches&rdquo; to their New Year celebrations. And every one,
      with, of course, the exception of those in Darwin, was blissfully
      unconscious of even the existence of the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s missus.
      Knowing the M&#259;luka by repute, however, every one was agreed that the
      &ldquo;Elsey had struck it lucky,&rdquo; until the telegraph wire,
      whispering the gossip of Darwin to the Katherine, whispered that the
      &ldquo;new Boss for the Elsey had been and gone and married a missus just
      before leaving the South, and was bringing her along with him.&rdquo; Then
      the Sanguine Scot was filled with wrath, the Company with compassion,
      while the Dandy&rsquo;s consternation found relief in a dismayed &ldquo;Heavens
      above!&rdquo; (The Dandy, by the way, was only a dandy in his love of
      sweet, clean clothes and orderly surroundings. The heart of the man had
      not a touch of dandyism in it.) The Head Stockman was absent in his camp.
      Had he been present, much might have been said on the &ldquo;advantages of
      having a woman about the place.&rdquo; The Wag, however, retained his
      usual flow of speech and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck up, chaps!&rdquo; he chuckled encouraging! &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      not all snorters, you know. You might have the luck to strike one of the
      &lsquo;ministering angel variety.&rsquo; &rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sanguine Scot had been thinking rapidly, and with characteristic
      hopefulness, felt he had the bull by the horns. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just
      have to block her, chaps; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A wire
      or two should do it&rdquo;; and, inviting the Dandy &ldquo;to come and
      lend a hand,&rdquo; led the way to the telegraph office; and presently
      there quivered into Darwin the first hint that a missus was not wanted at
      the Elsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would advise leaving wife behind till homestead can be repaired,&rdquo;
      it said; and, still confident of success, Mac felt that &ldquo;ought to do
      the trick.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
      give her something stronger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We in Darwin, having exhausted the sight-seeing resources of the little
      town, were wishing &ldquo;something interesting would happen,&rdquo; when
      the message was handed to the M&#259;luka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may do as a stopgap,&rdquo; he said, opening it, adding as he
      read it, &ldquo;It looks brimful of possibilities for interested
      onlookers, seeing it advises leaving the wife behind.&rdquo; The M&#259;luka
      spoke from experience, having been himself an interested onlooker &ldquo;down
      south,&rdquo; when it had been suggested there that the wife should be
      left behind while he spied out the land; for although the M&#259;luka knew
      most of the Territory, he had not yet been to the Elsey Cattle Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preferring to be &ldquo;the interested onlooker&rdquo; myself this time,
      when we went to the telegraph office it was the M&#259;luka who wired:
      &ldquo;Wife coming, secure buggy&rdquo;, and in an incredibly short space
      of time the answer was back: &ldquo;No buggy obtainable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin looked interested. &ldquo;Mac hasn&rsquo;t wasted much time in
      making inquiries,&rdquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in apologies or explanations,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka added
      shortly, and sent in reply: &ldquo;Wife can ride, secure suitable mount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sanguine Scot&rsquo;s fighting blood was up, and almost
      immediately the wire rapped out: &ldquo;No side-saddle obtainable. Stock
      horses all flash&rdquo;; and the onlookers stared in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mac&rsquo;s in deadly earnest this time,&rdquo; they said, and the
      M&#259;luka, with a quiet &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; went back to the
      telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the Territory everybody knows everybody else, but particularly the
      telegraph people; and it often happens that when telegrams of general
      interest are passing through, they are accompanied by confidential asides&mdash;little
      scraps of harmless gossip not intended for the departmental books;
      therefore it was whispered in the tail of the last message that the
      Katherine was watching the fight with interest, was inclined to &ldquo;reckon
      the missus a goer,&rdquo; and that public sympathy was with the stockman&mdash;the
      Katherine had its women-folk and was thankful; but the Katherine knew that
      although a woman in a settlement only rules her husband&rsquo;s home, the
      wife of a station-manager holds the peace and comfort of the stockmen in
      the hollow of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stock horses all flash,&rdquo; the Sanguine Scot said, and then
      went out and apologised to an old bay horse. &ldquo;We had to settle her
      hash somehow, Roper, old chap,&rdquo; he said, stroking the beautiful
      neck, adding tenderly as the grand old head nosed into him: &ldquo;You
      silly old fool! You&rsquo;d carry her like a lamb if I let you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s reply came, and Mac whistled in amazement.
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he said to those near him, &ldquo;she&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;a
      goer, a regular goer&rdquo;; and after much careful thought wired an inane
      suggestion about waiting until after the Wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin laughed outright, and an emphatic: &ldquo;Wife determined, coming
      Tuesday&rsquo;s train,&rdquo; from the M&#259;luka was followed by a
      complete breakdown at the Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Darwin came in twos and threes to discuss the situation, and while
      the men offered every form of service and encouragement, the women-folk
      spoke of a woman &ldquo;going bush&rdquo; as &ldquo;sheer madness.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Besides, no woman travels during the Wet,&rdquo; they said, and the
      M&#259;luka &ldquo;hoped she would prove the exception.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll be bored to death if she does reach the homestead
      alive,&rdquo; they prophesied; and I told them they were not very
      complimentary to the M&#259;luka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; they hastened to explain.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be camping out most of his time, miles away from the
      homestead,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;So will I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think,&rdquo; they corrected. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll find
      that a woman alone in a camp of men is decidedly out of place&rdquo;; and
      I felt severely snubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka suggested that he might yet succeed in persuading some
      suitable woman to come out with us, as maid or companion; but the
      opposition, wagging wise heads, pursed incredulous lips, as it declared
      that &ldquo;no one but a fool would go out there for either love or money.&rdquo;
      A prophecy that came true, for eventually we went &ldquo;bush&rdquo;
      womanless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he listened. &ldquo;Does the cap
      fit, little &rsquo;un?&rdquo; he asked; but the women-folk told him that
      it was not a matter for joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know there is not another white woman within a hundred-mile
      radius?&rdquo; they asked; and the M&#259;luka pointed out that it was not
      all disadvantage for a woman to be alone in a world of men. &ldquo;The men
      who form her world are generally better and truer men, because the woman
      in their midst is dependent on them alone, for companionship, and love,
      and protecting care,&rdquo; he assured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are selfish brutes,&rdquo; the opposition declared, rather
      irrelevantly, looking pointedly at the M&#259;luka.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with as much deference as he could command. &ldquo;Also,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;a woman alone in a world of men rarely complains of their
      selfishness&rdquo;; and I hastened to his assistance. &ldquo;Particularly
      when those men are chivalrous bushmen,&rdquo; I began, then hesitated,
      for, since reading the telegrams, my ideas of bush chivalry needed
      readjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly when those men are chivalrous bushmen,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      agreed, with the merry twinkle in his eyes; for he perfectly understood
      the cause of the sudden breakdown. Then he added gravely: &ldquo;For the
      average bushman will face fire, and flood, hunger, and even death itself,
      to help the frail or weak ones who come into his life; although he&rsquo;ll
      strive to the utmost to keep the Unknown Woman out of his environments
      particularly when those environments are a hundred miles from anywhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposition looked incredulous. &ldquo;Hunger and death!&rdquo; it
      said. &ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; It would just serve them right if she
      went; and the men folk pointed out that this was, now, hardly flattering
      to the missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka passed the interruption by without comment. &ldquo;The
      Unknown Woman is brimful of possibilities to a bushman,&rdquo; he went on;
      &ldquo;for although she&nbsp;<i>may&nbsp;</i>be all womanly strength and
      tenderness, she may also be anything, from a weak timid fool to a
      self-righteous shrew, bristling with virtue and indignation. Still,&rdquo;
      he added earnestly, as the opposition began to murmur, &ldquo;when a woman
      does come into our lives, whatever type she may be, she lacks nothing in
      the way of chivalry, and it rests with herself whether she remains an
      outsider or becomes just One of Us. Just One of Us,&rdquo; he repeated,
      unconsciously pleading hard for the bushman and his greatest need&mdash;&ldquo;not
      a goddess on a pedestal, but just a comrade to share our joys and sorrows
      with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposition wavered. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for those telegrams,&rdquo;
      it said. But Darwin, seeing the telegrams in a new light, took up the
      cudgels for the bushmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beggars,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t blame them.
      When you come to think of it, the Unknown Woman is brimful of
      possibilities.&rdquo; Even then, at the Katherine, the possibilities of
      the Unknown Woman were being tersely summed up by the Wag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sometimes get ten different sorts rolled into one,&rdquo;
      he said finally, after a long dissertation. &ldquo;But, generally
      speaking, there&rsquo;s just three sorts of &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s
      Snorters&mdash;the goers, you know&mdash;the sort that go rampaging round,
      looking for insults, and naturally finding them; and then there&rsquo;s
      fools; and <i>they&rsquo;re</i> mostly screeching when they&rsquo;re not
      smirking&mdash;the uncertain-coy-and-hard-to-please variety, you know,&rdquo;
      he chuckled, &ldquo;and then,&rdquo; he added seriously, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      the right sort, the sort you tell things to. They&rsquo;re A1 all through
      the piece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanguine Scot was confident, though, that they were all alike, and
      none of &rsquo;em were wanted; but one of the Company suggested &ldquo;If
      she was little, she&rsquo;d do. The little &rsquo;uns are all right,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But public opinion deciding that &ldquo;the sort that go messing round
      where they know they&rsquo;re not wanted are always big and muscular and
      snorters,&rdquo; the Sanguine Scot was encouraged in his determination to
      &ldquo;block her somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll block her yet; see if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said
      confidently. &ldquo;After all these years on their own, the boys don&rsquo;t
      want a woman messing round the place.&rdquo; And when he set out for the
      railway along the north track, to face the &ldquo;escorting trick,&rdquo;
      he repeated his assurances. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll block her, chaps, never
      fear,&rdquo; he said; and glowering at a &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; horse that
      had been sent by the lady at the Telegraph, added savagely, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      begin by losing that brute first turn out.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      From sun-up to sun-down on Tuesday, the train glided quietly forward on
      its way towards the Never-Never; and from sun-up to sun-down the M&#259;luka
      and I experienced the kindly consideration that it always shows to
      travellers: it boiled a billy for us at its furnace; loitered through the
      pleasantest valleys; smiled indulgently, and slackened speed whenever we
      made merry with blacks, by pelting them with chunks of water-melon; and
      generally waited on us hand and foot, the Man-in-Charge pointing out the
      beauty spots and places of interest, and making tea for us at frequent
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a delightful train&mdash;just a simple-hearted, chivalrous,
      weather-beaten old bush-whacker, at the service of the entire Territory.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the least bit officious or standoffish about
      it,&rdquo; I was saying, when the Man-in-Charge came in with the first
      billy of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; he said, unhooking cups from various
      crooked-up fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Territorian, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had all the false veneer of civilisation peeled off long ago,&rdquo;
      the M&#259;luka said, adding, with a sly look at my discarded gloves and
      gossamer, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how quietly the Territory does its
      work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man-in-Charge smiled openly as he poured out the tea, proving thereby
      his kinship with all other Territorians; and as the train came to a
      standstill, swung off and slipped some letters into a box nailed to an old
      tree-trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the far end of the train, away from the engine, the passengers&rsquo;
      car had been placed, and as in front of it a long, long line of
      low-stacked sinuous trucks slipped along in the rear of the engine, all
      was open view before us; and all day long, as the engine trudged onwards&mdash;hands
      in pockets, so to speak, and whistling merrily as it trudged&mdash;I stood
      beside the M&#259;luka on the little platform in front of the passengers&rsquo;
      car, drinking in my first deep, intoxicating draught of the glories of the
      tropical bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no fences to shut us in; and as the train zig-zagged through
      jungle and forest and river-valley&mdash;stopping now and then to drink
      deeply at magnificent rivers ablaze with water-lilies&mdash;it almost
      seemed as though it were some kindly Mammoth creature, wandering at will
      through the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, kangaroos and other wild creatures of the bush hopped out
      of our way, and sitting up, looked curiously after us; again and again
      little groups of blacks hailed us, and scrambled after water-melon and
      tobacco, with shouts of delight, and, invariably, on nearing the tiny
      settlements along the railway, we drove before us white fleeing flocks of
      goats.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every settlement we stopped and passed the time of day and, giving out
      mail-bags, moved on again into the forest. Now and again, stockmen rode
      out of the timber and received mail-bags, and once a great burly bushman,
      a staunch old friend of the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s, boarded the train, and
      greeted him with a hearty hand-shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! old chap!&rdquo; he called in welcome, as he mounted the
      steps of the little platform, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to inspect your
      latest investment&rdquo;; but catching sight of the &ldquo;latest
      investment&rdquo; he broke into a deafening roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he shouted, looking down upon me from his great
      height, &ldquo;is that all there is of her? They&rsquo;re expecting one of
      the prize-fighting variety down there,&rdquo; and he jerked his head
      towards the Never-Never. Then he congratulated the M&#259;luka on the size
      of his missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme the little &rsquo;uns,&rdquo; he said, nearly wringing my
      hand off in his approval. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em for pluck.
      My missus is one of &rsquo;em, and she went bush with me when I&rsquo;d
      nothing but a skeeto net and a quart-pot to share with her.&rdquo; Then,
      slapping the M&#259;luka vigorously on the back, he told him he&rsquo;d
      got some sense left. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat the little &rsquo;uns,&rdquo;
      he declared. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just the very thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka agreed with him, and after some comical quizzing, they
      decided, to their own complete satisfaction, that although the bushman&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;missus&rdquo; was the &ldquo;littlest of all little &rsquo;uns,
      straight up and down,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s &ldquo;knocked spots
      off her sideways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But although the Territory train does not need to bend its neck to the
      galling yoke of a minute time-table, yet, like all bush-whackers, it
      prefers to strike its supper camp before night-fall, and after allowing us
      a good ten minutes&rsquo; chat, it blew a deferential &ldquo;Ahem&rdquo;
      from its engine, as a hint that it would like to be &ldquo;getting along.&rdquo;
      The bushman took the hint, and after a hearty &ldquo;Good luck, missus!&rdquo;
      and a &ldquo;chin, chin, old man,&rdquo; left us, with assurances that
      &ldquo;her size &rsquo;ud do the trick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Until sundown we jogged quietly on, meandering through further pleasant
      places and meetings; drinking tea and chatting with the Man-in-Charge
      between whiles, extracting a maximum of pleasure from a minimum rate of
      speed: for travelling in the Territory has not yet passed that ideal stage
      where the travelling itself&mdash;the actual going&mdash;is all
      pleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached Pine Creek I confided to the men-folk that I was feeling
      a little nervous. &ldquo;Supposing that telegraphing bush-whacker decides
      to shoot me off-hand on my arrival,&rdquo; I said; and the Man-in-Charge
      said amiably: &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be brought in as justifiable homicide;
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Then reconnoitring the enemy from the platform,
      he &ldquo;feared&rdquo; we were &ldquo;about to be boycotted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There certainly were very few men on the station, and the Man-in-Charge
      recognising one of them as the landlord of the Playford, assured us there
      was nothing to fear from that quarter. &ldquo;You see, you represent
      business to him,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one but the landlord seemed to have urgent business in the office or
      at the far end of the platform, but it was quickly evident that there was
      nothing to fear from him; for, finding himself left alone to do the
      honours of the Creek, he greeted us with an amused: &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t
      look up to sample sent by telegram&rdquo;; and I felt every meeting would
      be, at least, unconventional. Then we heard that as Mac had &ldquo;only
      just arrived from the Katherine, he couldn&rsquo;t leave his horses until
      they were fixed up&rdquo;; but the landlord&rsquo;s eyes having wandered
      back to the &ldquo;Goer,&rdquo; he winked deliberately at the M&#259;luka
      before inviting us to &ldquo;step across to the Pub.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pub seemed utterly deserted, and with another wink the landlord
      explained the silence by saying that &ldquo;a cyclone of some sort&rdquo;
      had swept most of his &ldquo;regulars&rdquo; away; and then he went
      shouting through the echoing passages for a &ldquo;boy&rdquo; to &ldquo;fetch
      along tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the tea appeared, an angry Scotch voice crept to us through thin
      partitions, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a fit place for a woman, and,
      besides, nobody wants her!&rdquo; And in a little while we heard the same
      voice inquiring for &ldquo;the Boss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The telegraphing bush-whacker,&rdquo; I said, and invited the M&#259;luka
      to come and see me defy him. But when I found myself face to face with
      over six feet of brawny quizzing, wrathful-looking Scotchman, all my
      courage slipped away, and edging closer to the M&#259;luka, I held out my
      hand to the bushman, murmuring lamely: &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a change came over the rugged, bearded face. At the sight of the
      &ldquo;Goer&rdquo; reduced to a meek five feet, all the wrath died out of
      it, and with twitching lips and twinkling eyes Mac answered mechanically,
      &ldquo;Quite well thank you,&rdquo; and then coughed in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all: no fierce blocking, no defying. And with the cough, the
      absurdity of the whole affair, striking us simultaneously, left us
      grinning like a trio of Cheshire cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most eloquent grinning, making all spoken apology or explanation
      unnecessary; and by the time it had faded away we thoroughly understood
      each other, being drawn together by a mutual love of the ridiculous. Only
      a mutual love of the ridiculous, yet not so slender a basis for a lifelong
      friendship as appears, and by no means an uncommon one &ldquo;out bush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the station pay for the telegrams, or the loser?&rdquo; the
      landlord asked in an aside, as we went in to supper and after supper the
      preparations began for the morrow&rsquo;s start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanguine Scot, anxious to make amends for the telegrams, was full of
      suggestions for smoothing out the difficulties of the road. Like many men
      of his type, whatever he did he did it with all his heart and soul&mdash;hating,
      loving, avenging, or forgiving with equal energy; and he now applied
      himself to helping the M&#259;luka &ldquo;make things easy for her,&rdquo;
      as zealously as he had striven to &ldquo;block her somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorting out pack-bags, he put one aside, with a &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
      spare that for her duds. It won&rsquo;t do for her to be short. She&rsquo;ll
      have enough to put up with, without that.&rdquo; But when I thanked him,
      and said I could manage nicely with only one, as I would not need much on
      the road, he and the M&#259;luka sat down and stared at each other in
      dismay. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for everything you&rsquo;ll need till the
      waggons come,&rdquo; they explained; &ldquo;your road kit goes in your
      swag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggons went &ldquo;inside&rdquo; once a year&mdash;&ldquo;after the
      Wet,&rdquo; and would arrive at the homestead early in June. As it was
      then only the middle of January, I too sat down, and stared in dismay from
      the solitary pack-bag to the great, heaped-up pile that had been sorted
      out as indispensable. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to cull your herd a bit,
      that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Mac said; and needlework was pointed out as a
      luxury. Then books were &ldquo;cut out,&rdquo; after that the house linen
      was looked to, and as I hesitated over the number of pillow-cases we could
      manage with, Mac cried triumphantly: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need these
      anyway, for there&rsquo;s no pillows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka thought he had prepared me for everything in the way of
      roughness; but in a flash we knew that I had yet to learn what a bushman
      means by rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the pillow-cases fell to the ground, Mac was at a loss to account for
      my consternation. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone wrong?&rdquo; he exclaimed in
      concern. Mac was often an unconscious humorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the M&#259;luka came with his ever-ready sympathy. &ldquo;Poor little
      coon,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s little else but chivalry
      and a bite of tucker for a woman out bush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a light broke in on Mac. &ldquo;Is it only the pillows?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I thought something had gone wrong.&rdquo; Then his eyes
      began to twinkle. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s stacks of pillows in Darwin,&rdquo;
      he said meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly the moral fillip needed, and in another minute we were
      cheerfully &ldquo;culling our herd&rdquo; again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exposed to Mac&rsquo;s scorn, the simplest comforts became foolish
      luxuries. &ldquo;A couple of changes of everything is stacks,&rdquo; he
      said encouragingly, clearing a space for packing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      heaps of soap and water at the station, and things dry here before you can
      waltz round twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefulness is always infectious, and before Mac&rsquo;s cheery optimism
      the pile of necessities grew rapidly smaller. Indeed, with such visions of
      soap and water and waltzing washerwomen, a couple of changes of everything
      appeared absurd luxury. But even optimism can have disadvantages; for in
      our enthusiasm we forgot that a couple of cambric blouses, a cotton dress
      or two, and a change of skirts, are hardly equal to the strain of nearly
      five months constant wear and washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pillow-cases went in, however. Mac settled that difficulty by saying
      that &ldquo;all hands could be put on to pluck birds. The place is stiff
      with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he explained, showing what a simple matter it would
      be, after all. The M&#259;luka turning out two cushions, a large and a
      smaller one, simplified matters even more. &ldquo;A bird in the hand you
      know,&rdquo; he said, finding room for them in the swag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before all the arrangements were completed, others of the Creek had begun
      to thaw, and were &ldquo;lending a hand,&rdquo; here and there. The
      question of horses coming up, I confided in the helpers, that I was
      relieved to hear that the Telegraph had sent a quiet horse. &ldquo;I am <i>really</i>
      afraid of buck-jumpers, you know,&rdquo; I said, and the Creek looking
      sideways at Mac, he became incoherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look here!&rdquo; he spluttered, &ldquo;I say! Oh, look here!
      It really was too bad!&rdquo; Then, after an awkward pause, he blurted
      out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll think, but the brute
      strayed first camp, and&mdash;he&rsquo;s lost, saddle and all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka shot him a swift, questioning glance; but poor Mac looked
      so unhappy that we assured him &ldquo;we&rsquo;d manage somehow.&rdquo;
      Perhaps we could tame one of the flash buck-jumpers, the M&#259;luka
      suggested. But Mac said it &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad as that,&rdquo;
      and, making full confession, placed old Roper at our service.
    </p>
    <p>
      By morning, however, a magnificent chestnut &ldquo;Flash,&rdquo;
      well-broken into the side-saddle, had been conjured up from somewhere by
      the Creek. But two of the pack-horses had strayed, and by the time they
      were found the morning had slipped away, and it was too late to start
      until after dinner. Then after dinner a terrific thunderstorm broke over
      the settlement, and as the rain fell in torrents, Mac thought it looked
      &ldquo;like a case of to-morrow all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally I felt impatient at the delay, but was told by the Creek that
      &ldquo;there was no hurry!&rdquo; &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s still
      untouched,&rdquo; Mac explained. &ldquo;This is the Land of Plenty of
      Time; Plenty of Time and Wait a While. You&rsquo;ll be doing a bit of
      waiting before you&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this rain goes on, she&rsquo;ll be doing a bit of waiting at the
      Fergusson; unless she learns the horse&rsquo;s-tail trick,&rdquo; the
      Creek put in. On inquiry, it proved that the &ldquo;horse&rsquo;s-tail
      trick&rdquo; meant swimming a horse through the flood, and hanging on to
      its tail until it fought a way across; and I felt I would prefer &ldquo;waiting
      a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain did go on, and, roaring over the roof, made conversation
      difficult. The bushmen called it a &ldquo;bit of a storm&rdquo;; but every
      square inch of the heavens seemed occupied by lightning and thunder-bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to what we can do sometimes,&rdquo; every one agreed.
      &ldquo;<i>We</i>&nbsp;do things in style up here&mdash;often run
      half-a-dozen storms at once. You see, when you are weather-bound, you
      might as well have something worth looking at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm lasted nearly three hours, and when it cleared Mac went over to
      the Telegraph, where some confidential chatting must have taken place, for
      when he returned he told us that the Dandy was starting out for the
      homestead next day to &ldquo;fix things up a bit.&rdquo; The Head Stockman
      however, waited back for orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning dawned bright and clear, and Mac advised &ldquo;making a dash
      for the Fergusson.&rdquo; &ldquo;We might just get through before this
      rain comes down the valley,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creek was most enthusiastic with its help, bustling about with
      packbags and surcingles, and generally &ldquo;mixing things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came to say good-bye it showed signs of breaking down; but
      mastering its grief with a mightily audible effort, it wished us &ldquo;good
      luck,&rdquo; and stood watching as we rode out of the little settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time we looked back it raised its hat, and as we rode at the head of
      our orderly little cavalcade of pack horses, with Jackeroo the black
      &ldquo;boy&rdquo; bringing up the rear, we flattered ourselves on the
      dignity of our departure. Mac called it &ldquo;style,&rdquo; and the M&#259;luka
      was hoping that the Creek was properly impressed, when Flash, unexpectedly
      heading off for his late home, an exciting scrimmage ensued and the
      procession was broken into fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creek flew to the rescue, and, when order was finally restored, the
      woman who had defied the Sanguine Scot and his telegrams, entered the
      forest that fringes the Never-Never, sitting meekly upon a led horse.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bush chivalry demanding that a woman&rsquo;s discomfiture should be
      ignored, Mac kept his eyes on the horizon for the first quarter of a mile,
      and talked volubly of the prospects of the Wet and the resources of the
      Territory; but when Flash was released, and after a short tussle settled
      down into a free, swinging amble, he offered congratulations in his own
      whimsical way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like the rest of us,&rdquo; he said, with a sly,
      sidelong look at the M&#259;luka, &ldquo;perfectly reconciled to his fate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was only sixty-five miles to the Katherine it took us exactly
      three days to travel the distance. Mac called it a &ldquo;tip-top record
      for the Wet,&rdquo; and the M&#259;luka agreed with him; for in the
      Territory it is not the number of miles that counts, but what is met with
      in those miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first afternoon we met so many amiable-looking watercourses,
      that the Sanguine Scot grew more and hopeful about crossing the Fergusson
      that night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just do it if we push on,&rdquo; he said,
      after a critical look at the Cullen, then little more than a sweet, shady
      stream. &ldquo;Our luck&rsquo;s dead in. She&rsquo;s only just moving.
      Yesterday&rsquo;s rain hasn&rsquo;t come down the valleys yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We pushed on in the moonlight; but when we reached the Fergusson, two
      hours later, we found our luck was &ldquo;dead out,&rdquo; for &ldquo;she&rdquo;
      was up and running a banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac&rsquo;s hopes sank below zero. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo;
      he said ruefully, looking down at the swirling torrent, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a case of &lsquo;wait-a-while&rsquo; after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s hopes always died hard. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      still the Government yacht,&rdquo; he said, going to a huge iron punt that
      lay far above high-water mark. Mac called it a forlorn hope, and it looked
      it, as it lay deeply sunk in the muddy bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an immense affair, weighing over half a ton, and provided by a
      thoughtful Government for the transit of travellers &ldquo;stuck up&rdquo;
      by the river when in flood. An army of roughriders might have launched it,
      but as bushmen generally travel in single file, it lay a silent reproach
      to the wisdom of Governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jester had chalked on its sides &ldquo;H.M.S. Immovable&rdquo;; and
      after tugging valiantly at it for nearly half an hour, the M&#259;luka and
      Mac and Jackeroo proved the truth of the bushman&rsquo;s irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no choice but a camp on the wrong side of the river, and after
      &ldquo;dratting things&rdquo; in general, and the Cullen in particular,
      Mac bowed to the inevitable and began to unpack the team, stacking
      packbags and saddles up on the rocks off the wet grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the billy was boiling he was trying hard to be cheerful, but
      without much success. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, as we settled down
      round the fire, &ldquo;this is the Land of Plenty of Time, that&rsquo;s
      one comfort. Another whole week starts next Sunday&rdquo;; then relapsing
      altogether he added gloomily; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be spending it here, too,
      by the look of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless the missus feels equal to the horse&rsquo;s-tail trick&rdquo;
      the M&#259;luka suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missus felt equal to anything&nbsp;<i>but </i>the tail trick and said
      so; and conversation flagged for a while as each tried to hit upon some
      way out of the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mac gave his thigh a prodigious slap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struck
      it!&rdquo; he shouted, and pointing to a thick wire rope just visible in
      the moonlight as it stretched across the river from flood bank to flood
      bank, added hesitatingly: &ldquo;We send mail-bags&mdash;and&mdash;valuables
      over on that when the river&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to mistake his meaning, or the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      exclamation of relief, or that neither man doubted for moment that the
      woman was willing to be flung across a deep, swirling river on a swaying
      wire; and as many a man has appeared brave because he has lacked the
      courage to own to his cowardice, so I said airily that &ldquo;anything
      better than going back,&rdquo; and found the men exchanging glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going back,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said quietly: and
      then I learned that the Wet does not &ldquo;do things by half.&rdquo; Once
      they began to move the flood waters must have come down the valleys in
      tidal waves, the M&#259;luka explained. &ldquo;The Cullen we&rsquo;ve just
      left will probably be a roaring torrent by now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck between two rivers: that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
      happened,&rdquo; Mac added savagely. &ldquo;Might have guessed that
      miserable little Cullen was up to her old sneaking ways.&rdquo; And to
      explain Mac&rsquo;s former &ldquo;dratting,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way the rivers have up here. They entice travellers
      over with smiles and promises, and before they can get back, call down the
      flood waters and shut them in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I thought of the wire,&rdquo; Mac added cheerfully,
      and slipped into reminiscences of the Wet, drawing the M&#259;luka also
      into experiences. And as they drifted from one experience to another,
      forced camps for days on stony outcrops in the midst of seas of water were
      touched on lightly as hardly worth mentioning; while &ldquo;eating
      yourself out of tucker, and getting down to water-rats and bandicoots,&rdquo;
      compared favourably with a day or two spent in trees or on stockyard
      fences. As for crossing a river on a stout wire rope! After the first few
      reminiscences, and an incident or two in connection with &ldquo;doing the
      horse&rsquo;s-tail trick,&rdquo; that appeared an exceedingly safe and
      pleasant way of overcoming the difficulty, and it became very evident why
      women do not travel &ldquo;during the Wet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a singularly beautiful night, shimmering with warm tropical
      moonlight, and hoarse with the shouting of frogs and the roar of the river&mdash;a
      night that demanded attention; and, gradually losing interest in
      hair-breadth escapes from drowning, Mac joined in the song of the frogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quar-r-rt pot! Quar-r-rt pot!&rdquo; he sang in hoarse, strident
      minims, mimicking to perfection the shouts of the leaders, leaning with
      them on the &ldquo;quar-r-rt&rdquo; in harsh gutturals, and spitting out
      the &ldquo;pot&rdquo; in short, deep staccatos. Quicker and quicker the
      song ran, as the full chorus of frogs joined in. From minims to crotchets,
      and from crotchets to quavers it flowed, and Mac, running with it, gurgled
      with a new refrain at the quavers. &ldquo;More-water, more-water,
      hot-water, hot-water,&rdquo; he sang rapidly in tireless reiteration,
      until he seemed the leader and the frogs the followers, singing the words
      he put into their mouths. Lower and lower the chorus sank, but just before
      it died away, an old bull-frog started every one afresh with a slow,
      booming &ldquo;quar-r-rt pot!&rdquo; and Mac stopped for breath. &ldquo;Now
      you know the song of the frogs,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      teach you all the songs of the Never-Never in time; listen!&rdquo; and
      listening, it was hard to believe that this was our one-time telegraphing
      bush-whacker. Dropping his voice to a soft, sobbing moan, as a pheasant
      called from the shadows, he lamented with it for &ldquo;Puss! Puss! Puss!
      Puss! Poor Puss! Poor Puss!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound roused a dove in the branches above us, and as she stirred in
      her sleep and cooed softly, Mac murmured drowsily: &ldquo;Move-over-dear,
      Move-over dear&rdquo;; and the dove, taking up the refrain, crooned it
      again and again to its mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of the songs were not Mac&rsquo;s. They belong to the lore of
      the bushmen; but he sang or crooned them with such perfect mimicry of tone
      or cadence, that never again was it possible to hear these songs of the
      Never-Never without associating the words with the songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was full of sounds, and one by one Mac caught them up, and the
      bush appeared to echo him; and leaning half drowsily, against the
      pack-saddles and swags, we listened until we slipped into one of those
      quiet reveries that come so naturally to bush-folk. Shut in on all sides
      by bush and tall timber, with the rushing river as sentinel, we seemed in
      a world all our own&mdash;a tiny human world, with a camp fire for its
      hub; and as we dreamed on, half conscious of the moonlight and shoutings,
      the deep inner beauty of the night stole upon us. A mystical, elusive
      beauty difficult to define, that lay underneath and around, and within the
      moonlight&mdash;a beauty of deep nestling shadows, crooning whispers, and
      soft rustling movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while we dreamed on, and then the M&#259;luka broke the silence.
      &ldquo;The wizard of the Never-Never has not forgotten how to weave his
      spells while I&rsquo;ve been south,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
      be long before he has the missus in his toils. The false veneer of
      civilisation is peeling off at a great rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I roused as from a trance; and Mac threw a sharp, searching glance at me,
      as I sat curled up against a swag. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he
      laughed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a trace of the towney left.&rdquo; And
      rising to &ldquo;see about fixing up camp,&rdquo; he added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
      better look out, missus! Once caught, you&rsquo;ll never get free again.
      We&rsquo;re all tethered goats here. Every time we make up our minds to
      clear out, something pulls us back with a jerk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="page026" id="page026"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:75%;">
      <img src="images/page026.jpg" alt="0001 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/page026.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tethered goats!&rdquo; Mac called us, and the world must apply the
      simile as it thinks fit. The wizard of the Never-Never weaves his spells,
      until hardships, and dangers, and privations, seem all that make life
      worth living; and then holds us &ldquo;tethered goats&rdquo;; and every
      time the town calls us with promises of gaiety, and comfort, and security,
      &ldquo;something pulls us back with a jerk&rdquo; to our beloved bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign of rain; and as bushmen only pitch tent when a deluge is
      expected, our camp was very simple: just camp sleeping mosquito-nets, with
      calico tops and cheese net for curtains&mdash;hanging by cords between
      stout stakes driven into the ground. &ldquo;Mosquito pegs,&rdquo; the
      bushmen call these stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeroo, the unpoetical, was even then sound asleep in his net; and in
      ten minutes everything was &ldquo;fixed up.&rdquo; In another ten minutes
      we had also &ldquo;turned in,&rdquo; and soon after I was sound asleep,
      rolled up in a &ldquo;bluey,&rdquo; and had to be wakened at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river&rsquo;s still rising,&rdquo; Mac announced by way of
      good-morning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to bustle up and get across, or the
      water&rsquo;ll be over the wire, and then we&rsquo;ll be done for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bustle as we would, however &ldquo;getting across&rdquo; was a tedious
      business. It took nearly an hour&rsquo;s hustling and urging and galloping
      before the horses could be persuaded to attempt the swim, and then only
      after old Roper had been partly dragged and partly hauled through the
      back-wash by the amphibious Jackeroo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another half-hour slipped by in sending the horses&rsquo; hobbles across
      on the pulley that ran on the wire, and in the hobbling out of the horses.
      Then, with Jackeroo on one side of the river, and the M&#259;luka and Mac
      on the other, swags, saddles, packbags, and camp baggage went over one by
      one; and it was well past mid-day before all was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my turn came. A surcingle&mdash;one of the long thick straps that
      keep all firm on a pack-horse&mdash;was buckled through the pulley, and
      the M&#259;luka crossed first, just to test its safety. It was safe
      enough; but as he was dragged through the water most of the way, the
      pleasantness of &ldquo;getting across&rdquo; on the wire proved a myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac shortened the strap, and then sat me in it, like a child in a swing.
      &ldquo;Your lighter weight will run clear of the water,&rdquo; he said,
      with his usual optimism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter of holding on and
      keeping cool&rdquo;; and as the M&#259;luka began to haul he added final
      instructions. &ldquo;Hang on like grim death, and keep cool, whatever
      happens,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to obey, and all went well until I reached mid-stream. Then,
      the wire beginning to sag threateningly towards the water, Mac flung his
      whole weight on to his end of it, and, to his horror, I shot up into the
      air like a sky-rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang on! Keep cool!&rdquo; Mac yelled, in a frenzy of apprehension,
      as he swung on his end of the wire. Jackeroo became convulsed with
      laughter, but the M&#259;luka pulled hard, and I was soon on the right
      side of the river, declaring that I preferred experiences when they were
      over. Later Mac accounted for his terror with another unconscious flash of
      humour. &ldquo;You never can count on a woman keeping cool when the
      unexpected happens,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offered to haul him over. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter of holding on
      and keeping cool,&rdquo; we said; but he preferred to swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t think of telegraphing this
      performance,&rdquo; I shouted across the floods; but, in his relief, Mac
      was equal to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he shouted back gallantly,
      with a sweeping flourish of his hat; &ldquo;it might have blocked you
      coming.&rdquo; The bushman was learning a new accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his clothes were to come across on the wire, I was given a hint to
      &ldquo;make myself scarce&rdquo;; so retired over the bank, and helped
      Jackeroo with the dinner camp&mdash;an arrangement that exactly suited his
      ideas of the eternal fitness of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the morning he had expressed great disapproval that a woman should
      be idle, while men dragged heavy weights about. &ldquo;White fellow,
      big-fellow-fool all right,&rdquo; he said contemptuously, when Mac
      explained that it was generally so in the white man&rsquo;s country. A
      Briton of the Billingsgate type would have appealed to Jackeroo as a man
      of sound common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the men-folk appeared, he had decided that with a little
      management I would be quite an ornament to society. &ldquo;Missus bin help&nbsp;<i>me</i>&nbsp;all
      right,&rdquo; he told the Sanguine Scot, with comical self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac roared with delight, and the passage of the Fergusson having swept
      away the last lingering torch of restraint he called to the M&#259;luka;
      &ldquo;Jackeroo reckons he&rsquo;s tamed the shrew for us.&rdquo; Mac had
      been a reader of Shakespeare in his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon we were supposed to be &ldquo;making a dash&rdquo; for the
      Edith, a river twelve miles farther on; but there was nothing very dashing
      about our pace. The air was stiflingly, swelteringly hot, and the flies
      maddening in their persistence. The horses developed puffs, and when we
      were not being half-drowned in torrents of rain we were being parboiled in
      steamy atmosphere. The track was as tracks usually are &ldquo;during the
      Wet,&rdquo; and for four hours we laboured on, slipping and slithering
      over the greasy track, varying the monotony now and then with a
      floundering scramble through a boggy creek crossing. Our appearance was
      about as dashing as our pace; and draggled, wet through, and perspiring,
      and out of conceit with primitive travelling&mdash;having spent the
      afternoon combining a minimum rate of travelling with a maximum of
      discomfort&mdash;we arrived at the Edith an hour after sundown to find her
      a wide eddying stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be more than a ducking,&rdquo; Mac said cheerfully.
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be much wetter than we are,&rdquo; and the M&#259;luka
      taking the reins from my hands, we rode into the stream Mac keeping
      behind, &ldquo;to pick her up in case she floats off,&rdquo; he said,
      thinking he was putting courage into me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it looked; and after a little stumbling and
      plunging and drifting the horses were clambering out up the opposite bank,
      and by next sundown&mdash;after scrambling through a few more rivers&mdash;we
      found ourselves looking down at the flooded Katherine, flowing below in
      the valley of a rocky gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty-five miles in three days, against sixty miles an hour of the express
      trains of the world. &ldquo;Speed&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; cries the
      world, and speeds on, gaining little but speed; and we bush-folk travel
      our sixty miles and gain all that is worth gaining&mdash;excepting speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand-over-hand this time!&rdquo; Mac said, looking up at the
      telegraph wire that stretched far overhead. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no pulley
      here. Hand-over-hand, or the horse&rsquo;s-tail trick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mine Host of the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo; had seen us, and running down the
      opposite side of the gorge, launched a boat at the river&rsquo;s brink;
      then pulling up-stream for a hundred yards or so in the backwash, faced
      about, and raced down and across the swift-flowing current with long,
      sweeping strokes; and as we rode down the steep winding track to meet him,
      Mac became jocular, and reminding us that the gauntlet of the Katherine
      had yet to be run, also reminded us that the sympathies of the Katherine
      were with the stockmen; adding with a chuckle, as Mine Host bore down upon
      us. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even represent business here; no woman ever
      does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the boat grounded, and Mine Host sprang ashore&mdash;another burly
      six-foot bushman&mdash;and greeted us with a flashing smile and a laughing
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much of her left.&rdquo; And then, stepping with
      quiet unconcern into over two feet of water, pushed the boat against a
      jutting ledge for my convenience. &ldquo;Wet feet don&rsquo;t count,&rdquo;
      he laughed with another of his flashing smiles, when remonstrated with,
      and Mac chuckled in an aside, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you a woman doesn&rsquo;t
      represent business here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The swim being beyond the horses, they were left hobbled out on the north
      banks, to wait for the river to fall, and after another swift race down
      and across stream, Mine Host landed every one safely on the south side of
      the flood, and soon we were clambering up the steep track that led from
      the river to the &ldquo;Pub.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming up from the river, the Katherine Settlement appeared to consist
      solely of the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo; and its accompanying store; but beyond the
      &ldquo;Pub,&rdquo; which, by the way, seemed to be hanging on to its own
      verandah posts for support, we found an elongated, three-roomed building,
      nestling under deep verandahs, and half-hidden beneath a grove of lofty
      scarlet flowering ponchianas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cottage is always set apart for distinguished visitors,&rdquo;
      Mine Host said, bidding us welcome with another smile, but never a hint
      that he was placing his own private quarters at our disposal. Like all
      bushmen, he could be delicately reticent when conferring a favour; but a
      forgotten razor-strop betrayed him later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime we discovered the remainder of the Settlement from the
      Cottage verandahs, spying out the Police Station as it lurked in ambush
      just round the first bend in a winding bush track&mdash;apparently keeping
      one eye on the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo;; and then we caught a gleam of white
      roofs away beyond further bends in the track, where the Overland Telegraph
      &ldquo;Department&rdquo; stood on a little rise, aloof from the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo;
      and the Police, shut away from the world, yet attending to its affairs,
      and, incidentally, to those of the bush-folk: a tiny Settlement, with a
      tiny permanent population of four men and two women&mdash;women who found
      their own homes all-sufficient, and rarely left them, although the
      men-folk were here, there, and everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around and within the Settlement was bush: and beyond the bush,
      stretching away and away on every side of it, those hundreds of thousands
      of square miles that constitute the Never-Never&mdash;miles sending out
      and absorbing again from day to day the floating population of the
      Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before supper the Telegraph Department and the Police Station called on
      the Cottage to present compliments. Then the Wag came with his welcome.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect you to-day,&rdquo; he drawled, with
      unmistakable double meaning in his drawl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re come sooner
      than we expected. Must have had luck with the rivers&rdquo;; and Mac
      became enthusiastic. &ldquo;Luck!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Luck! She&rsquo;s
      got the luck of the Auld Yin himself&mdash;skinned through everything by
      the skin of our teeth. No one else&rsquo;ll get through those rivers under
      a week.&rdquo; And they didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the telegrams, the Wag shot a swift quizzing glance at him;
      but it took more than a glance to disconcert Mac once his mind was made
      up, and he met it unmoved, and entered into a vivid description of the
      &ldquo;passage of the Fergusson,&rdquo; which filled in our time until
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the Cottage returned the calls, and then, rain coming down in
      torrents, the Telegraph, the Police, the Cottage and the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo;
      retired to rest, wondering what the morrow would bring forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow brought forth more rain, and the certainty that, as the river
      was still rising, the swim would be beyond the horses for several days
      yet; and because of this uncertainty, the Katherine bestirred itself to
      honour its tethered guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Telegraph and the Police Station issued invitations for dinner, and
      the &ldquo;Pub&rdquo; that had already issued a hint that &ldquo;the boys
      could refrain from knocking down cheques as long as a woman was staying in
      the place&rdquo; now issued an edict limiting the number of daily drinks
      per man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitations were accepted with pleasure, and the edict was attended to
      with a murmur of approval in which, however, there was one dissenting
      voice: a little bearded bushman &ldquo;thought the Katherine was overdoing
      it a bit,&rdquo; and suggested as an amendment that &ldquo;drunks could
      make themselves scarce when she&rsquo;s about.&rdquo; But Mine Host easily
      silenced him by offering to &ldquo;see what the missus thought about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a day the Katherine &ldquo;took its bearings,&rdquo; and keen,
      scrutinising glances summed up the Unknown Woman, looking her through and
      through until she was no longer an Unknown Woman, while the M&#259;luka
      looked on interested. He knew the bush-folk well, and that their instinct
      would be unerring, and left the missus to slip into whichever niche in
      their lives they thought fit to place her. And as she slipped into a niche
      built up of strong, staunch comradeship, the black community considered
      that they, too, had fathomed the missus; and it became history in the camp
      that the M&#259;luka had stolen her from a powerful Chief of the Whites,
      and, deeming it wise to disappear with her until the affair had blown
      over, had put many flooded rivers between him and his pursuers. &ldquo;Would
      any woman have flung herself across rivers on wires, speeding on without
      rest or pause, unless afraid of pursuit?&rdquo; the camp asked in
      committee, and the most sceptical were silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed other days full of pleasant intercourse; for once sure of
      its welcome, bushmen are lavish with their friendship. And as we roamed
      about the tiny Settlement, the Wag and others vied with the M&#259;luka,
      Mine Host, and Mac in &ldquo;making things pleasant for the missus&rdquo;:
      relating experiences for her entertainment; showing all there was to be
      shown, and obeying the edict with cheerful, unquestioning chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the Head Stockman nor the little bushman, however, had made any
      offers of friendship, Dan having gone out to the station immediately after
      interviewing the M&#259;luka, while the little bushman spent most of his
      time getting out of the way of the missus whenever she appeared on his
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Tam-o-Shanter fleeing from the furies of a too fertile
      imagination,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka laughed after a particularly comical
      dash to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Tam! Those days must live in his memory like a hideous nightmare! I,
      of course, knew nothing of the edict at the time&mdash;for bushmen do not
      advertise their chivalry&mdash;and wandered round the straggling
      Settlement vaguely surprised at its sobriety, and turning up in such
      unexpected places that the little bushman was constantly on the verge of
      apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But experience teaches quickly. On the first day, after running into me
      several times, he learned the wisdom of spying out the land before turning
      a corner. On the second day, after we had come on him while thus engaged
      several other times, he learned the foolishness of placing too much
      confidence in corners, and deciding by the law of averages that the bar
      was the only safe place in the Settlement, availed himself of its
      sanctuary in times of danger. On the third day he learned that the law of
      averages is a weak reed to lean on; for on slipping round a corner, and
      mistaking a warning signal from the Wag, he whisked into the bar to whisk
      out again with a clatter of hobnailed boots, for I was in there examining
      some native curios. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in&nbsp;<i>there&nbsp;</i>next,&rdquo;
      he gasped as he passed the Wag on his way to the cover of the nearest
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Tam!&rdquo; How he must have hated women as he lurked in the
      doubtful ambush of that corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>How&nbsp;</i>he did skoot!&rdquo; the Wag chuckled later on when
      recounting with glee, to the M&#259;luka and Mac, the story of Tam&rsquo;s
      dash for cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitying Tam, I took his part, and said he seemed a sober, decent little
      man and couldn&rsquo;t help being shy; then paused, wondering at the queer
      expression on the men&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac coughed in embarrassment, and the M&#259;luka and the Wag seemed
      pre-occupied, and, fearing I had been misunderstood, I added hastily:
      &ldquo;So is everyone in the Settlement, for that matter,&rdquo; thereby
      causing further embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short intense silence the Wag &ldquo;thought he&rsquo;d be getting
      along,&rdquo; and as he moved off the M&#259;luka laughed. &ldquo;Oh,
      missus, missus!&rdquo; and Mac blurted out the whole tale of the edict&mdash;concluding
      rather ambiguously by saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go thinking it&rsquo;s
      made any difference to any of us, because it hasn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re not
      saints, but we&rsquo;re not pigs, and, besides, it was a pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I doubted if it was much pleasure to Tam-o-Shanter; but forgetting he was
      sober by compulsion, even he had begun to feel virtuous; and when he heard
      he had been called a &ldquo;sober, decent little man,&rdquo; he positively
      swaggered; and on the fourth morning walked jauntily past the Cottage and
      ventured a quiet good-morning&mdash;a simple enough little incident in
      itself; but it proved Tam&rsquo;s kinship with his fellowmen. For is it
      not the knowledge that some one thinks well of us that makes us feel at
      ease in that person&rsquo;s company?
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the same day, the flood having fallen, it was decided that it
      would be well to cross the horses in the rear of a boat, and we were all
      at the river discussing preparations, when Tam electrified the community
      by joining the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the awkward pause that followed his arrival he passed a general remark
      about dogs&mdash;there were several with us&mdash;and every one plunged
      into dog yarns, until Tam, losing his head over the success of his maiden
      speech, became so communicative on the subject of a dog-fight that he had
      to be surreptitiously kicked into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like more rain,&rdquo; Mac said abruptly, hoping to draw
      public attention from the pantomime. &ldquo;Ought to get off as soon as
      possible, or we&rsquo;ll be blocked at the King.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Katherine seized on the new topic of conversation, and advised &ldquo;getting
      out to the five-mile overnight,&rdquo; declaring it would &ldquo;take all
      day to get away from the Settlement in the morning.&rdquo; Then came
      another awkward pause, while every one kept one eye on Tam, until the M&#259;luka
      saved the situation by calling for volunteers to help with the horses,
      and, Tam being pressed into the service, the boat was launched, and he was
      soon safe over the far side of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once among the horses, the little man was transformed. In the quiet,
      confident horseman that rode down the gorge a few minutes later it would
      have been difficult to recognise the shy, timid bushman. The saddle had
      given him backbone, and it soon appeared he was right-hand man, and, at
      times, even organiser in the difficult task of crossing horses through a
      deep, swift-running current.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the flood was three or four hundred yards wide and many feet deep, a
      swim was impossible without help, and every horse was to be supported or
      guided, or dragged over in the rear of the boat, with a halter held by a
      man in the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no child&rsquo;s play. Every inch of the way had its difficulties.
      The poor brutes knew the swim was beyond them; and as the boat, pulling
      steadily on, dragged them from the shallows into the deeper water, they
      plunged and snorted in fear, until they found themselves swimming, and
      were obliged to give all their attention to keeping themselves afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some required little assistance when once off their feet; just a slow,
      steady pull from the oars, and a taut enough halter to lean on in the
      tight places. But others rolled over like logs when the full force of the
      current struck them, threatening to drag the boat under, as it and the
      horse raced away down stream with the oarsmen straining their utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard enough work for the oarsmen; but the seat of honour was in the
      stern of the boat, and no man filled it better than the transformed Tam.
      Alert and full of resource, with one hand on the tiller, he leaned over
      the boat, lengthening or shortening rope for the halter, and regulating
      the speed of the oarsmen with unerring judgment; giving a staunch swimmer
      time and a short rope to lean on, or literally dragging the faint-hearted
      across at full speed; careful then only of one thing: to keep the head
      above water. Never again would I judge a man by <i>one</i> of his
      failings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were ten horses in all to cross, and at the end of two hours&rsquo;
      hard pulling there was only one left to come&mdash;old Roper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac took the halter into his own hands&mdash;there was no one else worthy&mdash;and,
      slipping into the stern of the boat, spoke first to the horse and then to
      the oarsmen; and as the boat glided forward, the noble, trusting old horse&mdash;confident
      that his long-tried human friend would set him no impossible task&mdash;came
      quietly through the shallows, sniffing questions at the half-submerged
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him time!&rdquo; Mac called. &ldquo;Let him think it out,&rdquo;
      as step by step Roper followed, the halter running slack on the water.
      When almost out of his depth, he paused just a moment, then, obeying the
      tightening rope, lifted himself to the flood and struck firmly and bravely
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staunchly he and Mac dealt with the current: taking time and approaching
      it quietly, meeting it with taut rope and unflinching nerve, drifting for
      a few breaths to judge its force; then, nothing daunted, they battled
      forward, stroke after stroke, and won across without once pulling the boat
      out of its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Roper could have done it; and when the splendid neck and shoulders
      appeared above water as he touched bottom, on the submerged track, he was
      greeted with a cheer and a hearty, unanimous &ldquo;Bravo! old chap!&rdquo;
      Then Mac returned thanks with a grateful look, and, leaping ashore, looked
      over the beautiful, wet, shining limbs, declaring he could have &ldquo;done
      it on his own,&rdquo; if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once assured that we were anxious for a start, the Katherine set about
      speeding the parting guests with gifts of farewell. The Wag brought fresh
      tomatoes and a cucumber; the Telegraph sent eggs; the Police a freshly
      baked cake; the Chinese cook baked bread, and Mine Host came with a few
      potatoes and a flat-iron. To the surprise of the Katherine, I received the
      potatoes without enthusiasm, not having been long enough in the Territory
      to know their rare value, and, besides, I was puzzling over the flat iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo; I asked, and the Wag shouted in mock
      amazement: &ldquo;For! To iron duds with, of course,&rdquo; as Mine Host
      assured us it was of no use to him beyond keeping a door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still puzzled, I said I thought there would not be any need to iron duds
      until we reached the homestead, and the M&#259;luka said quietly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>for&nbsp;</i>the
      homestead. There will be nothing like that there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac exploded with an impetuous &ldquo;Good Heavens! What <i>does</i> she
      expect? First pillows and now irons!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually realising that down South we have little idea of what &ldquo;rough&rdquo;
      means to a bushman, I had from day to day been modifying my ideas of a
      station home from a mansion to a commodious wooden cottage, plainly but
      comfortably furnished. The Cottage had confirmed this idea, but Mac soon
      settled the question beyond all doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;Before she leaves
      this place she&rsquo;ll just <i>have</i> to grasp things a bit better,&rdquo;
      and sitting down on a swag he talked rapidly for ten minutes, taking a
      queer delight in making everything sound as bad as possible, &ldquo;knocking
      the stiffening out of the missus,&rdquo; as he phrased it, and certainly
      bringing the &ldquo;commodious station home&rdquo; about her ears, which
      was just as well, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few scathing remarks on the homestead in general, which he called
      &ldquo;One of those down-at-the-heels, anything-&rsquo;ll-do sort of
      places,&rdquo; he described The House. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly verandahs
      and promises,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but one room is finished. <i>We</i>
      call it The House, but you&rsquo;ll probably call it a Hut, even though it
      has got doors and calico windows framed and on hinges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed an inventory of the furniture. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one
      fairly steady, good-sized table at least it doesn&rsquo;t fall over,
      unless some one leans on it; then there&rsquo;s a bed with a wire
      mattress, but nothing else on it; and there&rsquo;s a chair or two up to
      your weight (the boss&rsquo;ll either have to stand up or lie down), and I
      don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s much else excepting plenty of cups and
      plates&mdash;they&rsquo;re enamel, fortunately, so you won&rsquo;t have
      much trouble with the servants breaking things. Of course there&rsquo;s a
      Christmas card and a few works of art on the walls for you to look at when
      you&rsquo;re tired of looking at yourself in the glass. Yes! There&rsquo;s
      a looking-glass&mdash;goodness knows how it got there! You ought to be
      thankful for that and the wire-mattress. You won&rsquo;t find many of them
      out bush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I humbly acknowledged thankfulness, and felt deeply grateful to Mine Host,
      when, with ready thoughtfulness he brought a couple of china cups and
      stood them among the baggage&mdash;the heart of Mine Host was as warm and
      sincere as his flashing smiles. I learned, in time, to be indifferent to
      china cups, but that flat-iron became one of my most cherished possessions&mdash;how
      it got to the Katherine is a long, long story, touching on three
      continents, a man, a woman, and a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commodious station home destroyed, the Katherine bestirred itself
      further in the speeding of its guests. The Telegraph came with the offer
      of their buggy, and then the Police offered theirs; but Mine Host,
      harnessing two nuggety little horses into his buck-board, drove round to
      the store, declaring a buck-board was the &ldquo;only thing for the road.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t feel the journey at all in it,&rdquo; he said, and
      drove us round the Settlement to prove how pleasant and easy travelling
      could be in the Wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No buggy obtainable,&rdquo; murmured the M&#259;luka, reviewing the
      three offers. But the Sanguine Scot was quite unabashed, and answered
      coolly: &ldquo;You forget those telegrams were sent to that other woman&mdash;the
      Goer, you know&mdash;there&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>no buggy obtainable for&nbsp;<i>her</i>.
      By George! Wasn&rsquo;t she a snorter? I knew I&rsquo;d block her somehow,&rdquo;
      and then he added with a gallant bow and a flourish: &ldquo;You can see
      for yourselves, chaps, that she didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wag mimicked the bow and the flourish, and then suggested accepting
      all three vehicles and having a procession &ldquo;a triumphal exit that&rsquo;ll
      knock spots off Pine Creek.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be one apiece,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and with
      Jackeroo as outrider, and loose horses to fill in with, we could make a
      real good thing of it if we tried. There&rsquo;s Tam, now; he&rsquo;s had
      a fair amount of practice lately, dodging round corners, and if he and I
      stood on opposite sides of the track, and dodged round bushes directly the
      procession passed coming out farther along, we could line the track for
      miles with cheering crowds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The buck-board only being decided on, he expressed himself bitterly
      disappointed, but promised to do his best with that and the horses; until
      hearing that Mac was to go out to the &ldquo;five-mile&rdquo; overnight
      with the pack-team and loose horses, leaving us to follow at sun-up, he
      became disconsolate and refused even to witness the departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;av willingly bust meself cheering a procession and
      lining the track with frantic crowds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
      too fat to work up any enthusiasm over two people in a buck-board.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before sundown Mac set out, after instructing the Katherine to
      &ldquo;get the buck-board off early,&rdquo; and just before the Katherine
      &ldquo;turned in&rdquo; for the night, the M&#259;luka went to the office
      to settle accounts with Mine Host.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes he was back, standing among the ponchianas, and then after
      a little while of silence he said gently: &ldquo;Mac was right. A woman
      does not represent business here.&rdquo; Mine Host had indignantly refused
      payment for a woman&rsquo;s board and lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to pay, though,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka laughed, with one of
      his quick changes of humour. &ldquo;But, then, I&rsquo;m only a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter5" id="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we arrived at the five-mile in the morning we found Mac &ldquo;packed
      up&rdquo; and ready for the start, and, passing the reins to him, the M&#259;luka
      said, &ldquo;You know the road best&rdquo;; and Mac, being what he called
      a &ldquo;bit of a Jehu,&rdquo; we set off in great style across country,
      apparently missing trees by a hair&rsquo;s breadth, and bumping over the
      ant-hills, boulders, and broken boughs that lay half-hidden in the long
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being nearly bumped out of the buck-board several times, I asked if
      there wasn&rsquo;t any track anywhere; and Mac once again exploded with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the track,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Good Heavens!
      do you mean to say you can&rsquo;t see it on ahead there?&rdquo; and he
      pointed towards what looked like thickly timbered country, plentifully
      strewn with further boulders and boughs and ant-hills; and as I shook my
      head, he shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re on the
      main transcontinental route from Adelaide to Port Darwin,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any track anywhere!&rdquo; he mimicked presently, as we lurched,
      and heaved, and bumped along. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll she say when we get
      into the long-grass country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long here!&rdquo; he ejaculated, when I thought the grass we were
      driving through was fairly long (it was about three feet). &ldquo;Just you
      wait!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited submissively, if bouncing about a buck-board over thirty miles of
      obstacles can be called waiting, and next day we &ldquo;got into the
      long-grass country&rdquo;, miles of grass, waving level with and above our
      heads&mdash;grass ten feet high and more, shutting out everything but
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka was riding a little behind, at the head of the pack-team,
      but we could see neither him nor the team, and Mac looked triumphantly
      round as the staunch little horses pushed on through the forest of grass
      that swirled and bent and swished and reeled all about the buck-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is what we
      call long grass&rdquo;; and he asked if I could &ldquo;see any track now.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as plain as a pikestaff,&rdquo; he declared, trying to
      show what he called a &ldquo;clear break all the way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m
      a dead homer all right,&rdquo; he shouted after further going as we came
      out at the &ldquo;King&rdquo; crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it! Hang on!&rdquo; he warned, and we went down the steep
      bank at a hand gallop; and as the horses rushed into the swift-flowing
      stream, he said unconcernedly: &ldquo;I wonder how deep this is,&rdquo;
      adding, as the buck-board lifted and swerved when the current struck it:
      &ldquo;By George! They&rsquo;re off their feet,&rdquo; and leaning over
      the splashboard, lashed at the undaunted little beasts until they raced up
      the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the style!&rdquo; he shouted in triumph, as they drew
      up, panting and dripping well over the rise from the crossing. &ldquo;Close
      thing, though! Did you get your feet wet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get your feet wet!&rdquo; That was all, when I was
      expecting every form of concern imaginable. For a moment I felt indignant
      at Mac&rsquo;s recklessness and lack of concern, and said severely,
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t take such risks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mac was blissfully unconscious of the severity. &ldquo;Risks!&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Why, it wasn&rsquo;t wide enough for anything to happen,
      bar a ducking. If you rush it, the horses are pushed across before they
      know they&rsquo;re off their feet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bar a ducking, indeed!&rdquo; But Mac was out of the buck-board,
      shouting back, &ldquo;Hold hard there! It&rsquo;s a swim,&rdquo; and
      continued shouting directions until the horses were across with
      comparatively dry pack-bags. Then he and the M&#259;luka shook hands and
      congratulated each other on being the right side of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more rivers!&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear run home, bar a deluge,&rdquo; Mac added, gathering up the
      reins. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll strike the front gate to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon we followed the telegraph line, and there the track was
      really well-defined; then at sundown Mac drew up, and with a flourish of
      hats he and the M&#259;luka bade the missus &ldquo;Welcome Home!&rdquo;
      All around and about was bush, and only bush, that, and the telegraph
      line, and Mac, touching on one of the slender galvanized iron poles,
      explained the welcome. &ldquo;This is the front gate.&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;another forty-five miles and we&rsquo;ll be knocking at the front
      door.&rdquo; And they called the Elsey &ldquo;a nice little place.&rdquo;
      Perhaps it was when compared with runs of six million acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp was pitched just inside the &ldquo;front gate,&rdquo; near a
      wide-spreading sheet of water, &ldquo;Easter&rsquo;s Billabong,&rdquo; and
      at supper-time the conversation turned on bush cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never tasted Johnny cakes!!&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Your education
      hasn&rsquo;t begun yet. We&rsquo;ll have some for breakfast; I&rsquo;m
      real slap-up at Johnny cakes!&rdquo; and rummaging in a pack-bag, he
      produced flour, cream-of-tartar, soda, and a mixing-dish, and set to work
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real slap-up at Johnny cakes! No mistake!&rdquo; he
      assured us, as he knelt on the ground, big and burly in front of the
      mixing-dish, kneading enthusiastically at his mixture. &ldquo;Look at
      that!&rdquo; as air-bubbles appeared all over the light, spongy dough.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I knew a thing or two about cooking?&rdquo;
      and cutting off nuggety-looking chunks, he buried them in the hot ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were cooked, crisp and brown, he displayed them with just pride.
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s slap-up at Johnny cakes?&rdquo;
      and standing them on end in the mixing-dish he rigged up tents&mdash;a
      deluge being expected&mdash;and carried them into his own for safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night the deluge came, and the billabong, walking up its flood
      banks, ran about the borders of our camp, sending so many exploring little
      rivulets through Mac&rsquo;s tent, that he was obliged to pass most of the
      night perched on a pyramid of pack bags and saddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, in the confusion and darkness, the dish of Johnny cakes
      became the base of the pyramid, and was consequently missing at breakfast
      time. After a long hunt Mac recovered it and stood looking dejectedly at
      the ruins of his cookery&mdash;a heap of flat, stodgy-looking slabs.
      &ldquo;Must have been sitting on &rsquo;em all night,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no other bread for breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt that we must eat them or go without bread of any kind;
      but as we sat tugging at the gluey guttapercha-like substance, Mac&rsquo;s
      sense of humour revived. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I was slap-up at
      Johnny cakes?&rdquo; he chuckled, adding with further infinitely more
      humorous chuckles: &ldquo;You mightn&rsquo;t think it; but I really am.&rdquo;
      Then he pointed to Jackeroo, who was watching in bewilderment while the M&#259;luka
      hunted for the crispest crust, not for himself, but the woman. &ldquo;White
      fellow big fellow fool all right! eh, Jackeroo?&rdquo; he asked, and
      Jackeroo openly agreed with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the black soil flats impassable after the deluge, Mac left the
      track, having decided to stick to the ridges all day; and all that had
      gone before was smoothness itself in comparison to what was in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day the buck-board rocked and bumped through the timber, and the M&#259;luka,
      riding behind, from time to time pointed out the advantages of travelling
      across country, as we bounced about the buck-board like rubber balls:
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so little chance of getting stiff with sitting still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time we tried to answer him we bit our tongues as the buck-board
      leapt over the tussocks of grass. Once we managed to call back, &ldquo;You
      won&rsquo;t feel the journey in a buck-board.&rdquo; Then an overhanging
      bough threatening to wipe us out of our seats, Mac shouted, &ldquo;Duck!&rdquo;
      and as we &ldquo;ducked&rdquo; the buck-board skimmed between two trees,
      with barely an inch to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit of a Jehu all right!&rdquo; Mac shouted
      triumphantly. &ldquo;It takes judgment to do the thing in style&rdquo;;
      and the next moment, swinging round a patch of scrub, we flew off at a
      tangent to avoid a fallen tree, crashing through its branches and grinding
      over an out-crop of ironstone to miss a big boulder just beyond the tree.
      It undoubtedly took judgment this &ldquo;travelling across country along
      the ridges&rdquo;; but the keen, alert bushman never hesitated as he swung
      in and out and about the timber, only once miscalculating the distance
      between trees, when he was obliged to back out again. Of course we barked
      trees constantly, but Mac called that &ldquo;blazing a track for the next
      travellers,&rdquo; and everywhere the bush creatures scurried out of our
      way; and when I expressed fears for the springs, Mac reassured me by
      saying a buck-board had none, excepting those under the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mac was a &ldquo;bit of a Jehu,&rdquo; he certainly was a &ldquo;dead
      homer,&rdquo; for after miles of scrub and grass and timber, we came out
      at our evening camp at the Bitter Springs, to find the Head Stockman
      there, with his faithful, tawny-coloured shadow, &ldquo;Old Sool em,&rdquo;
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dog and man greeted us sedately, and soon Dan had a billy boiling for us,
      and a blazing fire, and accepted an invitation to join us at supper and
      &ldquo;bring something in the way of bread along with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a commonplace remark about the trip out, he placed a crisp, newly
      baked damper on the tea-towel that acted as supper cloth; but when we all
      agreed that he was &ldquo;real slap-up at damper making,&rdquo; he scented
      a joke and shot a quick, questioning glance around; then deciding that it
      was wiser not to laugh at all than to laugh in the wrong place, he only
      said, he was &ldquo;not a bad hand at the damper trick.&rdquo; Dan liked
      his jokes well labelled when dealing with the unknown Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a bushman of the old type, one of the men of the droving days; full
      of old theories, old faiths, and old prejudices, and clinging always to
      old habits and methods. Year by year as the bush had receded and shrunk
      before the railways, he had receded with it, keeping always just behind
      the Back of Beyond, droving, bullock-punching, stock-keeping, and
      unconsciously opening up the way for that very civilisation that was
      driving him farther and farther back. In the forty years since his boyhood
      railways had driven him out of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland,
      and were now threatening even the Never-Never, and Dan was beginning to
      fear that they would not leave &ldquo;enough bush to bury a man in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough bush to bury a man in! That&rsquo;s all these men of the droving
      days have ever asked of their nation and yet without them the pioneers
      would have been tied hand and foot, and because of them Australia is what
      it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had a good trip out?&rdquo; Dan asked, feeling safe on that
      subject, and appeared to listen to the details of the road with interest;
      but all the time the shrewd hazel eyes were upon me, drawing rapid
      conclusions, and I began to feel absurdly anxious to know their verdict.
      That was not to come before bedtime; and only those who knew the life of
      the stations in the Never-Never know how much was depending on the
      stockmen&rsquo;s verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had his own methods of dealing with the Unknown Woman. Forty years
      out-bush had convinced him that &ldquo;most of &rsquo;em were the right
      sort,&rdquo; but it had also convinced him that &ldquo;you had to take
      &rsquo;em all differently,&rdquo; and he always felt his way carefully,
      watching and waiting, ready to open out at the first touch of fellowship
      and understanding, but just as ready to withdraw into himself at the
      faintest approach to a snub.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time supper was over he had risked a joke or two, and taking heart
      by their reception, launched boldly into the conversation, chuckling with
      delight as the M&#259;luka and Mac amused themselves by examining the
      missus on bushcraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll need a deal of educating before we let her out alone,&rdquo;
      he said, after a particularly bad failure, with the first touch of that
      air of proprietorship that was to become his favourite attitude towards
      his missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only common sense; you&rsquo;ll soon get used to it,&rdquo;
      Mac said in encouragement, giving us one of his delightful backhanders.
      Then in all seriousness Dan suggested teaching her some of the signs of
      water at hand, right off, &ldquo;in case she does get lost any time,&rdquo;
      and also seriously, the M&#259;luka and Mac &ldquo;thought it would be as
      well, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the townswoman&rsquo;s self-satisfied arrogance came to the surface.
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bother about me,&rdquo; I said, confident I had
      as much common sense as any bushman. &ldquo;If ever I do get lost, I&rsquo;ll
      just catch a cow and milk it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing nothing of the wild, scared cattle of the fenceless runs of the
      Never-Never, I was prepared for anything rather than the roar of delight
      that greeted that example of town &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missus! missus!&rdquo; the M&#259;luka cried, as soon as he could
      speak, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need a deal of educating&rdquo;; and while Mac
      gasped, &ldquo;Oh I say! Look here!&rdquo; Dan, with tears in his eyes,
      chuckled: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have a drouth on by the time she runs one
      down.&rdquo; Dan always called a thirst a drouth. &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo;
      he said, picturing the scene in his mind&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      catch a cow and milk it,&rsquo; she says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, dancing with fun, the hazel eyes looked round the company, and as
      Dan rose, preparatory to turning in, we felt we were about to hear their
      verdict. When it came it was characteristic of the man in uniqueness of
      wording:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the dead finish!&rdquo; he said, wiping his eyes on his
      shirt sleeve. &ldquo;Reckoned she was the minute I heard her talking about
      slap-up dampers&rdquo;; and in some indescribable way we knew he had paid
      the woman who was just entering his life the highest compliment in his
      power. Then he added, &ldquo;Told the chaps the little &rsquo;uns were
      generally all right.&rdquo; It is the helplessness of little women that
      makes them appear &ldquo;all right&rdquo; in the eyes of bushmen,
      helplessness being foreign to snorters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast Dan expressed surprise because there was no milk, and the
      pleasantry being well received, he considered the moment ripe for one of
      his pet theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do for this place!&rdquo; he said, wagging his head
      wisely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been forty years out-bush, and I&rsquo;ve known
      eight or ten women in that time, so I ought to know something about it.
      Anyway, the ones that could see jokes suited best. There was Mrs. Bob out
      Victoria way. She&rsquo;d see a joke a mile off; sighted &rsquo;em as soon
      as they got within cooee. Never knew her miss one, and never knew anybody
      suit the bush like she did.&rdquo; And, as we packed up and set out for
      the last lap of our journey he was still ambling about his theory. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;you can dodge most things out bush; but you can&rsquo;t
      dodge jokes for long. They&rsquo;ll run you down sooner or later&rdquo;;
      adding with a chuckle, &ldquo;Never heard of one running Mrs. Bob down,
      though. She always tripped &rsquo;em up before they could get to her.&rdquo;
      Then finding the missus had thrown away a &ldquo;good cup of tea just
      because a few flies had got into it,&rdquo; he became grave. &ldquo;Never
      heard of Mrs. Bob getting up to those tricks,&rdquo; he said, and doubted
      whether &ldquo;the missus&rsquo;ld do after all,&rdquo; until reassured by
      the M&#259;luka that &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be fishing them out with the
      indifference of a Stoic in a week or two&rdquo;; and I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When within a few miles of the homestead, the buckboard took a sharp turn
      round a patch of scrub, and before any one realised what was happening we
      were in the midst of a mob of pack horses, and face to face with the Quiet
      Stockman a strong, erect, young Scot, who carried his six foot two of bone
      and muscle with the lithe ease of a bushman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo&rdquo; Mac shouted, pulling up. Then, with the air of a
      showman introducing some rare exhibit, added: &ldquo;This is the missus,
      Jack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack touched his hat and moved uneasily in his saddle, answering Mac&rsquo;s
      questions in monosyllables. Then the M&#259;luka came up, and Mac, taking
      pity on the embarrassed bushman, suggested &ldquo;getting along,&rdquo;
      and we left him sitting rigidly on his horse, trying to collect his
      scattered senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was unrehearsed,&rdquo; Mac chuckled, as we drove on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      clearing out! Reckon he didn&rsquo;t set out exactly hoping to meet us,
      though. Tam&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s man in comparison,&rdquo; but loyal to
      his comrade above his amusement, he added warmly: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
      beat Jack by much, though, when it comes to sticking to a pal,&rdquo;
      unconscious that he was prophesying of the years to come, when the missus
      had become one of those pals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only the Dandy left now,&rdquo; Mac went on, as we
      spun along an ever more definite track, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll be all
      right as soon as he gets used to it. Never knew such a chap for finding
      something decent in everybody he strikes.&rdquo; Naturally I hoped he
      would &ldquo;find something decent in me,&rdquo; having learned what it
      meant to the stockmen to have a woman pitchforked into their daily lives,
      when those lives were to be lived side by side, in camp, or in saddle, or
      at the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac hesitated a moment, and then out flashed one of his happy
      inspirations. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bother about the Dandy,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;bushmen have a sixth sense, and know a pal when they see one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a bushman&rsquo;s pretty speech, aimed straight at the heart of a
      woman, where all the pretty speeches of the bushfolk are aimed; for it is
      by the heart that they judge us. &ldquo;Only a pal,&rdquo; they will say,
      towering strong and protecting; and the woman feels uplifted, even though
      in the same breath they have honestly agreed with her, after careful
      scrutiny, that it is not her fault that she was born into the plain
      sisterhood. Bushmen will risk their lives for a woman pal or otherwise but
      leave her to pick up her own handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Mac added, as an afterthought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      not often they find a pal in a woman&rdquo;; and I add to-day that when
      they do, that woman is to be envied her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyes front!&rdquo; Mac shouted suddenly, and in a moment the
      homestead was in sight, and the front gate forty-five miles behind us.
      &ldquo;If ever you&nbsp;<i>do</i>&nbsp;reach the homestead alive,&rdquo;
      the Darwin ladies had said; and now <i>they</i> were three hundred miles
      away from us to the north-west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s spotted us!&rdquo; Mac smiled as we skimmed on, and a
      slim little Chinaman ran across between the buildings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
      better do the thing in style,&rdquo; and whipping up the horses, he
      whirled them through the open slip-rails, past the stockyards, away across
      the grassy homestead enclosure, and pulled up with a rattle of hoofs and
      wheels at the head of a little avenue of buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dandy, fresh and spotless, appeared in a doorway; black boys sprang up
      like a crop of mushrooms and took charge of the buck-board; Dan rattled in
      with the pack-teams, and horses were jangling hobbles and rattling harness
      all about us, as I found myself standing in the shadow of a queer,
      unfinished building, with the M&#259;luka and Mac surrounded by a mob of
      leaping, bounding dogs, flourishing, as best they could, another &ldquo;Welcome
      home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mac asked, beating off dogs at every turn. &ldquo;Is
      it a House or a Hut?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Betwixt and Between,&rdquo; we decided; and then the Dandy was
      presented, And the steady grey eyes apparently finding &ldquo;something
      decent&rdquo; in the missus, with a welcoming smile and ready tact he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all real glad to see <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
      Just the tiniest emphasis on the word &ldquo;you&rdquo;; but that, and the
      quick, bright look that accompanied the emphasis, told, as nothing else
      could, that it was &ldquo;that other woman&rdquo; that had not been
      wanted. Unconventional, of course; but when a welcome is conventional
      out-bush, it is unworthy of the name of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka, knew this well, but before he could speak, Mac had seized
      a little half-grown dog&mdash;the most persistent of all the leaping dogs&mdash;by
      her tightly curled-up tail, and, setting her down at my feet, said:
      &ldquo;And this is Tiddle&rsquo;ums,&rdquo; adding, with another
      flourishing bow, &ldquo;A present from a Brither Scot,&rdquo; while Tiddle&rsquo;ums
      in no way resented the dignity. Having a tail that curled tightly over her
      back like a cup handle, she expected to be lifted up by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one after the other Mac presented the station dogs: Quart-Pot,
      Drover, Tuppence, Misery, Buller, and a dozen others; and as I bowed
      gravely to each in turn Dan chuckled in appreciation: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      do! Told you she was the dead finish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the introductions over, the M&#259;luka said: &ldquo;And now I
      suppose she may consider herself just &lsquo;One of Us.&rsquo; &rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      The homestead, standing half-way up the slope that rose from the
      billabong, had, after all, little of that &ldquo;down-at-heels, anything&rsquo;ll-do&rdquo;
      appearance that Mac had so scathingly described. No one could call it a
      &ldquo;commodious station home,&rdquo; and it was even patched up and
      shabby; but, for all that, neat and cared for. An orderly little array of
      one-roomed buildings, mostly built of sawn slabs, and ranged round a broad
      oblong space with a precision that suggested the idea of a section of a
      street cut out from some neat compact little village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook&rsquo;s quarters, kitchens, men&rsquo;s quarters, store,
      meat-house, and waggon-house, facing each other on either side of this
      oblong space, formed a short avenue&mdash;the main thoroughfare of the
      homestead&mdash;the centre of which was occupied by an immense wood-heap,
      the favourite gossiping place of some of the old black fellows, while
      across the western end of it, and looking down it, but a little aloof from
      the rest of the buildings, stood the house, or, rather, as much of it as
      had been rebuilt after the cyclone of 1897. As befitted their social
      positions the forge and black boys&rsquo; &ldquo;humpy&rdquo; kept a
      respectful distance well round the south-eastern corner of this
      thoroughfare; but, for some unknown reason, the fowl-roosts had been
      erected over Sam Lee&rsquo;s sleeping-quarters. That comprised this tiny
      homestead of a million and a quarter acres, with the Katherine Settlement
      a hundred miles to the north of it, one neighbour ninety miles to the
      east, another, a hundred and five to the south, and others about two
      hundred to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Mac&rsquo;s description of the House had been only too
      correct. With the exception of the one roughly finished room at its
      eastern end, it was &ldquo;mostly verandahs and promises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the cyclone had wrecked the building, scattering timber and sheets
      of iron in all directions, everything had lain exactly where it had fallen
      for some weeks, at the mercy of the wind and weather. At the end of those
      weeks a travelling Chinese carpenter arrived at the station with such
      excellent common-sense ideas of what a bush homestead should be, that he
      had been engaged to rebuild it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plans showed a wide-roofed building, built upon two-foot piles, with
      two large centre rooms opening into each other and surrounded by a deep
      verandah on every side; while two small rooms, a bathroom and an office,
      were to nestle each under one of the eastern corners of this deep
      twelve-foot verandah. Without a doubt excellent common-sense ideas; but,
      unfortunately, much larger than the supply of timber. Rough-hewn posts for
      the two-foot piles and verandah supports could be had for the cutting, and
      therefore did not give out; but the man used joists and uprights with such
      reckless extravagance, that by the time the skeleton of the building was
      up, the completion of the contract was impossible. With philosophical
      indifference, however, he finished one room completely; left a second a
      mere outline of uprights and tye-beams; apparently forgot all about the
      bathroom and office; covered the whole roof, including verandahs, with
      corrugated iron; surveyed his work with a certain amount of stolid
      satisfaction; then announcing that &ldquo;wood bin finissem,&rdquo;
      applied for his cheque and departed; and from that day nothing further has
      been done to the House, which stood before us &ldquo;mostly verandahs and
      promises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mac&rsquo;s description of the House had been apt, he had sadly
      underrated the furniture. There were&nbsp;<i>four&nbsp;</i>chairs, all
      &ldquo;up&rdquo; to my weight, while two of them were up to the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s.
      The cane was all gone, certainly, but had been replaced with green-hide
      seats (not green in colour, of course, only green in experience, never
      having seen a tan-pit). In addition to the chairs, the dining-table, the
      four-poster bed, the wire mattress, and the looking glass, there was a
      solid deal side table, made from the side of a packing-case, with four
      solid legs and a solid shelf underneath, also a remarkably steady
      washstand that had no ware of any description, and a remarkably unsteady
      chest of four drawers, one of which refused to open, while the other three
      refused to shut. Further, the dining-table was more than &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;
      steady, three of the legs being perfectly sound, and it therefore only <i>threatened</i>
      to fall over when leaned upon. And lastly, although most of the plates and
      all the cups were enamel ware, there was almost a complete dinner service
      in china. The teapot, however, was tin, and, as Mac said, as &ldquo;big as
      a house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the walls, not only were the &ldquo;works of art&rdquo; there, but
      they themselves were uniquely dotted from ceiling to floor with the muddy
      imprints of dogs&rsquo; feet&mdash;not left there by a Pegasus breed of
      winged dogs, but made by the muddy feet of the station dogs, as they
      pattered over the timber, when it lay awaiting the carpenter, and no one
      had seen any necessity to remove them. Outside the verandahs, and all
      around the house, was what was to be known later as the garden, a grassy
      stretch of hillocky ground, well scratched and beaten down by dogs, goats,
      and fowls; fenceless itself, being part of the grassy acres which were
      themselves fenced round to form the homestead enclosures. Just inside this
      enclosure, forming, in fact, the south-western barrier of it, stood the
      &ldquo;billabong,&rdquo; then a spreading sheet of water; along its banks
      flourished the vegetable garden; outside the enclosure, towards the
      south-east, lay a grassy plain a mile across, and to the north-west were
      the stock-yards and house paddock&mdash;a paddock of five square miles,
      and the only fenced area on the run; while everywhere to the northwards,
      and all through the paddock, were dotted &ldquo;white-ant&rdquo; hills,
      all shapes and sizes, forming brick-red turrets among the green scrub and
      timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Mac said, after we had completed a survey. &ldquo;I
      said it wasn&rsquo;t a fit place for a woman, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Head-stockman was in one of his argumentative moods. &ldquo;Any
      place is a fit place for a woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;provided the
      woman is fitted for the place. The right man in the right place, you know.
      Square people shouldn&rsquo;t try to get into round holes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>square&nbsp;</i>enough!&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      interrupted; and Mac added, &ldquo;And so is the&nbsp;<i>hole</i>,&rdquo;
      with a scornful emphasis on the word &ldquo;hole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan chuckled, and surveyed the queer-looking building with new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It reminds me of a banyan tree with corrugated-iron foliage,&rdquo;
      he said, adding as he went into details, &ldquo;In a dim light the
      finished room would pass for the trunk of the tree and the uprights for
      the supports of the branches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the M&#259;luka thought it looked more like a section of a mangrove
      swamp, piles and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks very like a house nearly finished,&rdquo; I said severely;
      for, because of the verandah and many promises, I was again hopeful for
      something approaching that commodious station home. &ldquo;A few
      able-bodied men could finish the dining-room in a couple of days, and make
      a mansion of the rest of the building in a week or so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the able-bodied men had a different tale to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady! Go slow, missus!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;It may <i>look</i>
      like a house very nearly finished, but out-bush, we have to catch our
      hares before we cook them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i>&nbsp;begin at the very beginning of things in the
      Never-Never,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka explained. &ldquo;Timber grows in
      trees in these parts, and has to be coaxed out with a saw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad habit it&rsquo;s got into,&rdquo; Dan chuckled;
      then pointing vaguely towards the thickly wooded long Reach, that lay a
      mile to the south of the homestead, beyond the grassy plain, he &ldquo;supposed
      the dining-room was down there just now, with the rest of the House.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With fast-ebbing hopes I looked in dismay at the distant forest undulating
      along the skyline, and the M&#259;luka said sympathetically, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      only too true, little un&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan disapproved of spoken sympathy under trying circumstances. &ldquo;It
      keeps &rsquo;em from toeing the line&rdquo; he believed; and fearing I was
      on the point of showing the white feather he broke in with: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      have to keep her toeing the line, Boss,&rdquo; and then pointed out that
      &ldquo;things might be worse.&rdquo; &ldquo;In some countries there are no
      trees to cut down,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the style,&rdquo; he added, when I began to laugh in
      spite of my disappointment, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon get you educated up to
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the Sanguine Scot had found the bright side of the situation,
      and reminded us that we were in the Land of Plenty of Time. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      time enough for everything in the Never-Never,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      have many a pleasant ride along the Reach choosing trees for timber.
      Catching the hare&rsquo;s often the best part of the fun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac&rsquo;s cheery optimism always carried all before it. Pleasant rides
      through shady forest-ways seemed a fair recompense for a little delay; and
      my spirits went up with a bound, to be dashed down again the next moment
      by Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got to the beginning of things yet,&rdquo; he
      interrupted, following up the line of thought the M&#259;luka had at first
      suggested. &ldquo;Before any trees are cut down, we&rsquo;ll have to dig a
      saw-pit and find a pit-sawyer.&rdquo; Dan was not a pessimist; he only
      liked to dig down to the very root of things, besides objecting to
      sugar-coated pills as being a hindrance to education.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Dandy had joined the group, and being practical, suggested &ldquo;trying
      to get hold of little Johnny,&rdquo; declaring that &ldquo;he would make
      things hum in no time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac happened to know that Johnny was &ldquo;inside&rdquo; somewhere on a
      job, and it was arranged that Dan should go in to the Katherine at once
      for nails and &ldquo;things,&rdquo; and to see if the telegraph people
      could find out Johnny&rsquo;s whereabouts down the line, and send him
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      But preparations for a week&rsquo;s journey take time, outbush, owing to
      that necessity of beginning at the beginning of things. Fresh horses were
      mustered, a mob of bullocks rounded up for a killer, swags and pack-bags
      packed; and just as all was in readiness for the start, the Quiet Stockman
      came in, bringing a small mob of colts with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; he announced in the Quarters; then,
      feeling some explanation was necessary, added, &ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>thinking
      of it before this happened.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, this may be true,
      although he omitted to say that he had abandoned the idea for some little
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was surprised, and no one thought of asking <i>what</i> had
      happened, for Jack had always steered clear of women, as he termed it. Not
      that he feared or disliked them, but because he considered that they had
      nothing in common with men. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re such terrors for asking
      questions,&rdquo; he said once, when pressed for an opinion, adding as an
      afterthought, &ldquo;They never seem to learn much either,&rdquo; in his
      own quiet way, summing up the average woman&rsquo;s conversation with a
      shy bushman: a long string of purposeless questions, followed by inane
      remarks on the answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving!&rdquo; Jack had said, and later met the M&#259;luka
      unshaken in his resolve. There was that in the M&#259;luka, however, that
      Jack had not calculated on&mdash;a something that drew all men to him, and
      made Dan speak of him in after-years as the &ldquo;best boss ever I struck&rdquo;;
      and although the interview only lasted a few minutes, and the M&#259;luka
      spoke only of the work of the station, yet in those few minutes the Quiet
      Stockman changed his mind, and the notice was never given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying on,&rdquo; was all he said on returning to the
      Quarters; and quick decisions being unusual with Jack, every one felt
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to give her a chance?&rdquo; Dan asked with a grin, and Jack
      looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen the boss,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan nodded with approval. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some sense left, then,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;if you know a good boss when you see one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack agreed in monosyllables; but when Dan settled down to argue out the
      advantages of having a woman about the place, he looked doubtful; but
      having nothing to say on the subject, said nothing; and when Dan left for
      the Katherine next morning he was still unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan set out for the north track soon after sun-up, assuring us that he&rsquo;d
      get hold of Johnny somehow; and before sun-down a traveller crossed the
      Creek below the billabong at the south track, and turned into the
      homestead enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were vaguely chatting on all and sundry matters, as we sat under the
      verandah that faced the billabong, when the traveller came into sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horse traveller!&rdquo; Mac said, lazily shading his eyes, and then
      sprang to his feet with a yell. &ldquo;Talk of luck!&rdquo; he shouted.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, missus! Here&rsquo;s Johnny himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Johnny, sure enough; but Johnny had a cheque in his pocket, and was
      yearning to see the &ldquo;chaps at the Katherine&rdquo;; and, after a
      good look through the House and store, decided that he really would have
      to go in to the Settlement for&mdash;tools and &ldquo;things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a week, missus,&rdquo; he said next morning,
      as he gathered his reins together before mounting, &ldquo;and then we shan&rsquo;t
      be long. Three days in and three out, you know, bar accidents, and a day&rsquo;s
      spell at the Katherine,&rdquo; he explained glibly. But the &ldquo;chaps
      at the Katherine&rdquo; proved too entertaining for Johnny, and a
      fortnight passed before we saw him again.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter7" id="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Quiet Stockman was a Scotchman, and, like many Scotchmen, a strange
      contradiction of shy reserve and quiet, dignified self-assurance. Having
      made up his mind on women in general, he saw no reason for changing it;
      and as he went about his work, thoroughly and systematically avoided me.
      There was no slinking round corners though; Jack couldn&rsquo;t slink. He
      had always looked the whole world in the face with his honest blue eyes,
      and could never do otherwise. He only took care that our paths did not
      cross more often than was absolutely necessary; but when they did, his
      Scotch dignity asserted itself, and he said what had to be said with quiet
      self-possession, although he invariably moved away as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just Jack&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; the Sanguine Scot said,
      anxious that his fellow Scot should not be misunderstood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
      be all there if ever you need him. He only draws the line at
      conversations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I mounted the stockyard fence one morning, to see the breaking-in
      of the colts, he looked as though he &ldquo;drew the line&rdquo; at that
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Jack&rsquo;s peace of mind, horse-breaking was not the
      only novelty at the homestead. Only a couple of changes of everything, in
      a tropical climate, meant an unbroken cycle of washing-days, while, apart
      from that, Sam Lee was full of surprises, and the lubras&rsquo; methods of
      house-cleaning were novel in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was bland, amiable, and inscrutable, and obedient to irritation; and
      the lubras were apt, and merry, and open-hearted, and wayward beyond
      comprehension. Sam did exactly as he was told, and the lubras did exactly
      as they thought fit, and the results were equally disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was asked for a glass of milk, and the lubras were told to scrub the
      floor. Sam brought the milk immediately, and the lubras, after scrubbing
      two or three isolated patches on the floor, went off on some frolic of
      their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      At afternoon tea there was no milk served. &ldquo;There was none,&rdquo;
      Sam explained blandly. &ldquo;The missus had drunk it all. Missus bin
      finissem milk all about,&rdquo; he said When the lubras were brought back,&nbsp;<i>they&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<i>they&nbsp;</i>had
      &ldquo;knocked up longa scrub,&rdquo; and finished the floor under
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka offered assistance; but I thought I ought to manage them
      myself, and set the lubras to clean and strip some feathers for a pillow&mdash;the
      M&#259;luka had been busy with a shot-gun&mdash;and suggested to Sam that
      he might spend some of his spare time shooting birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac had been right when he said the place was stiff with birds. A deep
      fringe of birds was constantly moving in and about and around the
      billabong; and the perpetual clatter of the plovers and waders formed an
      undercurrent to the life at the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lubras worked steadily for a quarter of an hour at the feathers; then
      a dog-fight demanding all their attention, the feathers were left to the
      mercy of the winds, and were never gathered together. At sundown Sam fired
      into a colony of martins that Mac considered the luck of the homestead.
      Right into their midst he fired, as they slept in long, graceful garlands
      one beside the other along the branches of a gum-tree, each with its head
      snugly tucked away out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missus want feather!&rdquo; Sam said, with his unfathomable smile,
      when Mac flared out at him, and again the missus appeared the culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka advised making the orders a little clearer, and Sam was
      told to use more discretion in his obedience, and, smiling and apologetic,
      promised to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lubras also promised to be more painstaking, reserving only the right
      to rest if they should &ldquo;knock up longa work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka, Mac and the Dandy, looked on in amusement while the
      missus wrestled with the servant question; and even the Quiet Stockman
      grinned sympathetically at times, unconsciously becoming interested in a
      woman who was too occupied to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five days I &ldquo;wrestled&rdquo;; and the only comfort I had was in
      Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie, a gentle-faced old lubra&mdash;almost sweet-faced.
      She undoubtedly did her best, and, showing signs of friendship, was
      invaluable in &ldquo;rounding up&rdquo; the other lubras when they showed
      signs of &ldquo;knocking up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the sixth day Sam surpassed himself in obedience. I had
      hinted that breakfast should be a little earlier, adding timidly that he
      might use a little more ingenuity in the breakfast menu, and at the first
      grey streak of dawn breakfast was announced, and, dressing hurriedly, we
      sat down to what Sam called &ldquo;Pump-pie-King pie with raisins and
      mince.&rdquo; The expression on Sam&rsquo;s face was celestial. No other
      word could describe it. There was also an underlying expression of triumph
      which made me suspicious of his apparent ingenuousness, and as the lubras
      had done little else but make faces at themselves in the looking-glass for
      two days (I was beginning to hate that looking-glass), I appealed to the M&#259;luka
      for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Sam in hand, and the triumph slipped away from beneath the stolid
      face, and a certain amount of discrimination crept into his obedience from
      henceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Sanguine Scot said that he would &ldquo;tackle the lubras for
      her,&rdquo; and in half an hour everywhere was swept and garnished, and
      the lubras were meek and submissive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to rule them with a rod of iron,&rdquo; Mac said,
      secretly pleased with his success. But there was one drawback to his
      methods, for next day, with the exception of Nellie, there were no lubras
      to rule with or without a rod of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy, the water-carrier and general director of the woodheap gossip,
      explained that they had gone off with the camp lubras for a day&rsquo;s
      recreation; &ldquo;Him knock up longa all about work,&rdquo; he said, with
      an apologetic smile. Jimmy was either apologetic or condescending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie rounded them up when they returned, and the M&#259;luka suggested,
      as a way out of the difficulty, that I should try to make myself more
      attractive than the camp lubras, which Mac said &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t be
      difficult,&rdquo; and then coughed, doubtful of the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the Creek at once to carry out the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      suggestion, and succeeded so well that I was soon the centre of a
      delighted dusky group, squatting on its haunches, and deep in fascinations
      of teaching an outsider its language. The uncouth mispronunciations
      tickled the old men beyond description, and they kept me gurgling at
      difficult gutturals, until, convulsed at the contortion of everyday words
      and phrases, they echoed Dan&rsquo;s opinion in queer pidgin-English that
      the &ldquo;missus needed a deal of education.&rdquo; Jimmy gradually
      became loftily condescending, and as for old Nellie, she had never enjoyed
      anything quite so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly I made myself attractive to the blackfellow mind; for, besides
      having proved an unexpected entertainment, I had made every one feel
      mightily superior to the missus. That power of inspiring others with a
      sense of superiority is an excellent trait to possess when dealing with a
      black fellow, for there were more than enough helpers next day, and the
      work was done quickly and well, so as to leave plenty of time for
      merry-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka and Mac were full of congratulations. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      got the mob well in hand now,&rdquo; Mac said, unconscious that he was
      about to throw everything into disorder again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six years Mac had been in charge of the station, and when he heard
      that the M&#259;luka was coming north to represent the owners, he had
      decided to give bullock-punching a turn as a change from stock-keeping.
      Sanguine that &ldquo;there was a good thing in it,&rdquo; he had bought a
      bullock waggon and team while in at the Katherine, and secured &ldquo;loading&rdquo;
      for &ldquo;inside.&rdquo; Under these circumstances it was difficult to
      understand why he had been so determined in his blocking, the only reason
      he could ever be cajoled into giving being &ldquo;that he was off the
      escorting trick, and, besides, the other chaps had to be thought of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now about to go to &ldquo;see to things,&rdquo; taking Bertie, his
      right-hand boy, with him, but leaving Nellie with me. Bertie had expressed
      himself quite agreeable to the arrangement, but at the eleventh hour
      refused to go without Nellie; and Nellie, preferring the now fascinating
      homestead to the company of her lord and master, refused to go with him,
      and Mac was at his wits&rsquo; end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to carry her off by force, so two days were spent in
      shrill ear-splitting arguments the threads of Nellie&rsquo;s argument
      being that Bertie could easily &ldquo;catch nuzzer lubra,&rdquo; and that
      the missus &ldquo;must have one good fellow lubra on the staff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac, always chivalrous, said he would manage somehow without Bertie,
      rather than &ldquo;upset things&rdquo;; but the M&#259;luka would not
      agree, and finally Nellie consented to go, on condition that she would be
      left at the homestead when the waggons went through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mac came and confessed a long-kept secret. Roper belonged to the
      station, and he had no claim on him beyond fellowship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      ridden him ever since I came here, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said, his
      arm thrown across the old horse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have stuck to him
      somehow, fair means or foul, if I hadn&rsquo;t seen you know how to treat
      a good horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka instantly offered fair means, but Mac shook his head.
      &ldquo;Let the missus have him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ll
      both have a good time. But I&rsquo;m first offer when it comes to selling.&rdquo;
      So the grand old horse was passed over to me to be numbered among the
      staunchest and truest of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Mac said in good-bye. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that
      end&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; and he pointed to Nellie, safely stowed away in a
      grove of dogs that half filled the back of the buck-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all had not ended for us. So many lubras put themselves on the
      homestead staff to fill the place left vacant by Nellie, that the one room
      was filled to overflowing while the work was being done, and the M&#259;luka
      was obliged to come to the rescue once more. He reduced the house staff to
      two, allowing a shadow or two extra in the persons of a few old black
      fellows and a piccaninny or two, sending the rejected to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning there was a free fight in camp between the staff and some
      of the camp lubras, the rejected, led by Jimmy&rsquo;s lubra&mdash;another
      Nellie&mdash;declaring the M&#259;luka had meant two different lubras each
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was much ear-splitting argument, but finally a compromise was
      agreed on. Two lubras were to sit down permanently, while as many as
      wished might help with the washing and watering. Then the staff and the
      shadows settled down on the verandah beside me to watch while I evolved
      dresses for two lubras out of next to nothing in the way of material, and
      as I sewed, the M&#259;luka, with some travellers who were &ldquo;in&rdquo;
      to help him, set to work to evolve a garden also out of next to nothing in
      the way of material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopeless as it looked, oblong beds were soon marked out at each of the
      four corners of the verandah, and beyond the beds a broad path was made to
      run right round the House. &ldquo;The wilderness shall blossom like the
      rose,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said, planting seeds of a vigorous-growing
      flowering bean at one of the corner posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers were deeply interested in the servant wrestle, and when the
      Staff was eventually clothed, and the rejected green with envy, decided
      that the &ldquo;whole difficulty was solved, bar Sam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, however, was about to solve his part of the difficulty to every one&rsquo;s
      satisfaction. A master as particular over the men&rsquo;s table as his own
      was not a master after Sam&rsquo;s heart, so he came to the M&#259;luka,
      and announced, in the peculiar manner of Chinese cooks, that he was about
      to write for a new cook for the station, who would probably arrive within
      six weeks, when Sam, having installed him to our satisfaction, would, with
      our permission, leave our service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The permission was graciously given, and as Sam retired we longed to tell
      him to engage some one renowned for his disobedience. We fancied later
      that our willingness piqued Sam, for after giving notice he bestirred
      himself to such an extent that one of our visitors tried to secure his
      services for himself, convinced we were throwing away a treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that fortnight we had several visitors, travellers passing through the
      station, and as each stayed a day or two, a few of the visits overlapped,
      and some merry hours were spent in the little homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the guests knew beforehand of the arrival of a missus at the
      station, and came ready groomed from their last camp; but others only
      heard of her arrival when inside the homestead enclosure, and there was a
      great application of soap, and razors, and towels before they considered
      themselves fit for presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only one room at our disposal it would seem to the uninitiated that
      the accommodation of the homestead must have been strained to bursting
      point; but &ldquo;out-bush&rdquo; every man carries a &ldquo;bluey&rdquo;
      and a mosquito net in his swag, and as the hosts slept under the verandah,
      and the guests on the garden paths, or in their camps among the forest
      trees, spare rooms would only have been superfluous. With a billabong at
      the door, a bathroom was easily dispensed with; and as every one preferred
      the roomy verandahs for lounging and smoking, the House had only to act as
      a dressing-room for the hosts and a dining-room for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meals, of course, were served on the dining-table; but no apology
      seemed necessary for the presence of a four-poster bed and a washing stand
      in the reception-room. They were there, and our guests knew why they were
      there, and words, like the spare rooms, would have been superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast at sun-up or thereabouts, dinner at noon and supper at sun-down,
      is the long-established routine of meals on all cattle-runs of the
      Never-Never, and at all three meals Sam waited, bland and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missus, of course, had one of the china cups, and the guests enamel
      ware; and the flies hovering everywhere in dense clouds, saucers rested on
      the top of the cups by common consent. Bread, scones, and such thing were
      covered over with serviettes throughout all meals while hands were kept
      busy &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; flies out of prospective mouthfuls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything lacked conventionality, and was accepted as a matter of course;
      and although at times Sam sorely taxed my gravity by using the bed for a
      temporary dumb waiter, the bushmen showed no embarrassment, simply because
      they felt none, and retained their self-possession with unconscious
      dignity. They sat among the buzzing swarms of flies, light-hearted and
      self-reliant, chatting of their daily lives of lonely vigils, of
      cattle-camps and stampedes, of dangers and privations, and I listened with
      a dawning consciousness that life &ldquo;out-bush&rdquo; is something more
      than mere existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being within four miles of the Overland Telegraph&mdash;that backbone of
      the overland route&mdash;rarely a week was to pass without someone coming
      in, and at times our travellers came in twos and threes, and as each
      brought news of that world outside our tiny circle, carrying in perhaps an
      extra mail to us, or one out for us, they formed a strong link in the
      chain that bound us to Outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      In them every rank in bush life was represented, from cattle-drovers and
      stockmen to the owners of stations, from swag-men and men &ldquo;down in
      their luck&rdquo; to telegraph operators and heads of government
      departments, men of various nationalities with, foremost among them, the
      Scots, sons of that fighting race that has everywhere fought with and
      conquered the Australian bush. Yet, whatever their rank or race, our
      travellers were men, not riff-raff; the long, formidable stages that wall
      in the Never-Never have seen to that, turning back the weaklings and
      worthless to the flesh-pots of Egypt, and proving the worth and mettle of
      the brave-hearted: all men, every one of them, and all in need of a little
      hospitality, whether of the prosperous and well-doing or &ldquo;down in
      their luck,&rdquo; and each was welcomed according to that need; for
      out-bush rank counts for little: we are only men and women there. And all
      who came in, and went on, or remained, gave us of their best while with
      us; for there was that in the M&#259;luka that drew the best out of all
      men. In life we generally find in our fellow-men just what we seek, and
      the M&#259;luka, seeking only the good, found only the good and drew much
      of it into his own sympathetic, sunny nature. He demanded the best and was
      given the best, and while with him, men found they were better men than at
      other times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our guests sat with us at table, some with the men, and some
      &ldquo;grubbed in their camps.&rdquo; All of them rode in strangers and
      many of them rode out life-long friends, for such is the way of the
      bushfolk: a little hospitality, a day or two of mutual understanding, and
      we have become part of the other&rsquo;s life. For bush hospitality is
      something better than the bare housing and feeding of guests, being just
      the simple sharing of our daily lives with a fellow-man&mdash;a literal
      sharing of all that we have; of our plenty or scarcity, our joys or
      sorrows, our comforts or discomforts, our security or danger; a democratic
      hospitality, where all men are equally welcome, yet so refined in its
      simplicity and wholesomeness, that fulsome thanks or vulgar apologies have
      no part in it, although it was whispered among the bushfolk that those
      &ldquo;down in their luck&rdquo; learned that when the M&#259;luka was
      filling tucker-bags, a timely word in praise of the missus filled
      tucker-bags to over-flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred and fifty guests was the tally for that year, and earliest
      among them came a telegraph operator, who as is the way with telegraphic
      operators out-bush invited us to &ldquo;ride across to the wire for a
      shake hands with Outside&rdquo;; and within an hour we came in sight of
      the telegraph wire as our horses mounted the stony ridge that overlooks
      the Warloch ponds, when the wire was forgotten for a moment in the
      kaleidoscope of moving, ever-changing colour that met our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two wide-spreading limpid ponds, the Warloch lay before us, veiled in a
      glory of golden-flecked heliotrope and purple water-lilies, and floating
      deep green leaves, with here and there gleaming little seas of water,
      opening out among the lilies, and standing knee-deep in the margins a
      rustling fringe of light reeds and giant bulrushes. All round the ponds
      stood dark groves of pandanus palms, and among and beyond the palms tall
      grasses and forest trees, with here and there a spreading colabar
      festooned from summit to trunk with brilliant crimson strands of
      mistletoe, and here and there a gaunt dead old giant of the forest, and
      everywhere above and beyond the timber deep sunny blue and flooding
      sunshine. Sunny blue reflected, with the gaunt old trees, in the tiny
      gleaming seas among the lilies, while everywhere upon the floating leaves
      myriads and myriads of grey and pink &ldquo;gallah&rdquo; parrots and
      sulphur-crested cockatoos preened feathers, or rested, sipping at the
      water&mdash;grey and pink verging to heliotrope and snowy white, touched
      here and there with gold, blending, flower-like, with the golden-flecked
      glory of the lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we waited, spell-bound in the brilliant sunshine; then the
      dogs running down to the water&rsquo;s edge, the gallahs and cockatoos
      rose with gorgeous sunrise effect: a floating gray-and-pink cloud, backed
      by sunlit flashing white. Direct to the forest trees they floated and,
      settling there in their myriads, as by a miracle the gaunt, gnarled old
      giants of the bush all over blossomed with garlands of grey, and pink, and
      white, and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the operator, being unpoetical, had ridden on to the &ldquo;wire,&rdquo;
      and presently was &ldquo;shinning up&rdquo; one of its slender galvanised
      iron posts as a preliminary to the &ldquo;handshake&rdquo;; for tapping
      the line being part of the routine of a telegraph operator in the
      Territory, &ldquo;shinning up posts,&rdquo; is one of his necessary
      accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In town, dust, and haste, and littered papers, and nerve-racking bustle
      seem indispensable to the sending of a telegram; but when the bush-folk
      &ldquo;shake hands&rdquo; with Outside all is sunshine and restfulness,
      soft beauty and leisurely peace. With the murmuring bush about us, in the
      clear space kept always cleared beneath those quivering wires, we stood
      all dressed in white, first looking up at the operator as, clinging to his
      pole, he tapped the line, and then looking down at him as he knelt at our
      feet with his tiny transmitter beside him clicking out our message to the
      south folk. And as we stood, with our horses&rsquo; bridles over our arms
      and the horses nibbling at the sweet grasses, in touch with the world in
      spite of our isolation, a gorgeous butterfly rested for a brief space on
      the tiny instrument, with gently swaying purple wings, and away in the
      great world men were sending telegrams amid clatter and dust, unconscious
      of that tiny group of bushfolk, or that Nature, who does all things well,
      can beautify even the sending of a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heart of the bush we stood yet listening to the clatter of the
      townsfolk, for, business over, the little clicking instrument was
      gossiping cheerily with us&mdash;the telegraph wire in the Territory being
      such a friendly wire. Daily it gathers gossip, and daily whispers it up
      and down the line, and daily news and gossip fly hither and thither: who&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;inside,&rdquo; who has gone out, whom to expect, where the mailman
      is, the newest arrival in Darwin and the latest rainfall at Powell&rsquo;s
      Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily the telegraph people hear all the news of the Territory, and in due
      course give the news to the public, when the travellers gathering it,
      carry it out to the bushfolk, scattering it broadcast, until everybody
      knows every one else, and all his business and where it has taken him; and
      because of that knowledge, and in spite of those hundreds of thousands of
      square miles of bushland, the people of the Territory are held together in
      one great brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among various items of news the little instrument told us that Dan was
      &ldquo;packing up for the return trip&rdquo;; and in a day or two he came
      in, bringing a packet of garden seeds and a china teapot from Mine Host,
      Southern letters from the telegraph, and, from little Johnny, news that he
      was getting tools together and would be along in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in one of his whimsical moods, Dan withheld congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking things over, boss,&rdquo; he said,
      assuming his most philosophical manner &ldquo;and I reckon any more rooms&rsquo;ll
      only interfere with getting the missus educated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he used the servant question to hang his argument on. &ldquo;Just
      proves what I was saying&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the cleaning of one
      room causes all this trouble and worry, where&rsquo;ll she be when she&rsquo;s
      got four to look after? What with white ants, and blue mould, and mildew,
      and wrestling with lubras, there won&rsquo;t be one minute to spare for
      education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He also professed disapproval of the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s devices for
      making the homestead more habitable. &ldquo;If this goes on we&rsquo;ll
      never learn her nothing but loafin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he declared when he
      found that a couple of yards of canvas and a few sticks had become a
      comfortable lounge chair. &ldquo;Too much luxury!&rdquo; and he sat down
      on his own heels to show how he scorned luxuries. A tree sawn into short
      lengths to provide verandah seats for all comers he passed over as
      doubtful. He was slightly reassured however, when he heard that my
      revolver practice had not been neglected, and condescended to own that
      some of the devices were &ldquo;handy enough.&rdquo; A neat little tray,
      made from the end of a packing-case and a few laths, interested him in
      particular. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get him dodged for ideas one of these
      days,&rdquo; he said, alluding to the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s ingenuity, and
      when, a day or two later, I broke the spring of my watch and asked
      helplessly, &ldquo;However was I going to tell the time till the waggons
      came with the clock?&rdquo; Dan felt sure I had set an unsolvable problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;ud get anybody dodged,&rdquo; he declared; but it took
      more than that to &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      resourcefulness. He spent a little while in the sun with a compass and a
      few wooden pegs, and a sundial lay on the ground just outside the
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan declared it just &ldquo;licked creation,&rdquo; and wondered if
      &ldquo;that &rsquo;ud settle &rsquo;em,&rdquo; when I asked for some
      strong iron rings for a curtain. But the Dandy took a hobble chain to the
      forge, and breaking the links asunder, welded them into smooth round
      rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for curtain rings was very pressing, for, scanty as it was, the
      publicity of our wardrobe hanging in one corner of the reception room
      distressed me, but with the Dandy&rsquo;s rings and a chequered rug for
      curtain, a corner wardrobe was soon fixed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan looked at it askance, and harked back to the sundial and education.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;cute enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t
      do, boss. She should have been taught how to tell the time by the sun. Don&rsquo;t
      you let &rsquo;em spoil your chances of education, missus. You were in
      luck when you struck this place; never saw luck to equal it. And if it
      holds good, something&rsquo;ll happen to stop you from ever having a
      house, so as to get you properly educated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My luck &ldquo;held good&rdquo; for the time being; for when Johnny came
      along in a few days he announced, in answer to a very warm welcome, that
      &ldquo;something had gone wrong at No. 3 Well&rdquo; and that &ldquo;he&rsquo;d
      promised to see to it at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Johnny!&rdquo; I cried reproachfully, but the next moment was
      &ldquo;toeing the line&rdquo; even to the Head Stockman&rsquo;s
      satisfaction; for with a look of surprise Johnny had added: &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      thought you&rsquo;d reckon that travellers&rsquo; water for the Dry came
      before your rooms.&rdquo; Out-bush we deal in hard facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d reckon!&rdquo; I said, appalled to think my
      comfort should even be spoken of when men&rsquo;s lives were in question.
      &ldquo;Of course I do; I didn&rsquo;t understand, that was all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t finished her education yet,&rdquo; Dan explained,
      and the M&#259;luka added, &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s learning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny looked perplexed. &ldquo;Oh, well! That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo;
      he said, rather ambiguously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as
      possible, and then we shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he left the homestead bound for the well, and as he
      disappeared into the Ti-Tree that bordered the south track, most of us
      agreed that &ldquo;luck was out.&rdquo; Only Dan professed to think
      differently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more wonderful than ever,&rdquo; he
      declared; &ldquo;more wonderful than ever, and if it holds good we&rsquo;ll
      never see Johnny again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter8" id="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Considering ourselves homeless, the M&#259;luka decided that we should
      &ldquo;go bush&rdquo; for awhile during Johnny&rsquo;s absence beginning
      with a short tour of inspection through some of the southern country of
      the run; intending, if all were well there, to prepare for a general
      horse-muster along the north of the Roper. Nothing could be done with the
      cattle until &ldquo;after the Wet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Dan and the inevitable black &ldquo;boy&rdquo; were to be with us on
      this preliminary walk-about; but all hands were to turn out for the
      muster, to the Quiet Stockman&rsquo;s dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought they mostly sat about and sewed,&rdquo; he said in the
      quarters. Little did the Sanguine Scot guess what he was doing when he
      &ldquo;culled&rdquo; needlework from the &ldquo;mob&rdquo; at Pine Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk-about was looked upon as a reprieve, and when a traveller,
      expressing sympathy, suggested that &ldquo;it might sicken her a bit of
      camp life,&rdquo; Jack clung to that hope desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the nigger world turned up to see the &ldquo;missus mount,&rdquo;
      that still being something worth seeing. Apart from the mystery of the
      side-saddle, and the joke of seeing her in an enormous mushroom hat, there
      was the interest of the mounting itself; Jackeroo having spread a report
      that the M&#259;luka held out his hands, while the missus ran up them and
      sat herself upon the horse&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They reckon you have escaped from a &lsquo;Wild West Show,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      Dan said, tickled at the look of wonder on some of the faces as I settled
      myself in the saddle. We learned later that Jackeroo had tried to run up
      Jimmy&rsquo;s hands to illustrate the performance in camp, and, failing,
      had naturally blamed Jimmy, causing report to add that the M&#259;luka was
      a very Samson in strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dress rehearsal for the cattle-musters later on,&rdquo; Dan
      called the walk-about, looking with approval on my cartridge belt and
      revolver; and after a few small mobs of cattle had been rounded up and
      looked over, he suggested &ldquo;rehearsing that part of the performance
      where the missus gets lost, and catches cows and milks &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your chance, missus,&rdquo; he shouted, as a scared,
      frightened beast broke from the mob in hand, and went crashing through the
      undergrowth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one all by herself to practice on.&rdquo;
      Dan&rsquo;s system of education, being founded on object-lessons, was
      mightily convincing; and for that trip, anyway, he had a very humble pupil
      to instruct in the &ldquo;ways of telling the signs of water at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All day as we zigzagged through scrub and timber, visiting water-holes and
      following up cattle-pads, the solitude of the bush seemed only a pleasant
      seclusion; and the deep forest glades, shady pathways leading to the
      outside world; but at night, when the camp had been fixed up in the silent
      depths of a dark Leichhardt-pine forest, the seclusion had become an
      isolation that made itself felt, and the shady pathways, miles of dark
      treacherous forest between us and our fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no isolation so weird in its feeling of cut-offness as that of a
      night camp in the heart of the bush. The flickering camp-fires draw all
      that is human and tangible into its charmed circle, and without, all is
      undefinable darkness and uncertainty. Yet it was in this night camp among
      the dark pines, with even the stars shut out, that we learnt that out-bush
      &ldquo;Houselessness&rdquo; need not mean &ldquo;Homelessness&rdquo;&mdash;a
      discovery that destroyed all hope that &ldquo;this would sicken her a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were only to be out one night, and there was little chance of rain,
      we had nothing with us but a little tucker, a bluey each, and a couple of
      mosquito nets. The simplicity of our camp added intensely to the
      isolation; and as I stood among the dry rustling leaves, looking up at the
      dark broad-leaved canopy above us, with my &ldquo;swag&rdquo; at my feet,
      the M&#259;luka called me a &ldquo;poor homeless little coon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman with a swag sounds homeless enough to Australian ears, but Dan,
      with his habit of looking deep into the heart of things, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
      exactly see where the homelessness came in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We had finished supper, and the M&#259;luka stretching himself luxuriously
      in the firelight, made a nest in the warm leaves for me to settle down in.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Dan,&rdquo; he said, after a short silence,
      &ldquo;when I come to think of it; I don&rsquo;t exactly see myself where
      the homelessness comes in. A bite and a sup and a faithful dog, and a
      guidwife by a glowing hearth, and what more is needed to make a home. Eh,
      Tiddle&rsquo;ums?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiddle&rsquo;ums having for some time given the whole of her heart to the
      M&#259;luka, nestled closer to him and Dan gave an appreciative chuckle,
      and pulled Sool&rsquo;em&rsquo;s ears. The conversation promised to suit
      him exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never got farther than the dog myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did
      I, Sool&rsquo;em, old girl?&rdquo; But Sool&rsquo;em becoming effusive
      there was a pause until she could be persuaded that &ldquo;nobody wanted
      none of her licking tricks.&rdquo; As she subsided Dan went on with his
      thoughts uninterrupted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen others at the guidwife
      business, though, and it didn&rsquo;t seem too bad, but I never struck it
      in a camp before. There was Mrs. Bob now. You&rsquo;ve heard me tell of
      her? I don&rsquo;t know how it was, but while she was out at the &ldquo;Downs&rdquo;
      things seemed different. She never interfered and we went on just the
      same, but everything seemed different somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka suggested that perhaps he had &ldquo;got farther than the
      dog&rdquo; without knowing it, and the idea appearing to Dan, he &ldquo;reckoned
      it must have been that.&rdquo; But his whimsical mood had slipped away, as
      it usually did when his thoughts strayed to Mrs. Bob; and he went on
      earnestly, &ldquo;She was the right sort if ever there was one. I know
      &rsquo;em, and she was one of &rsquo;em. When you were all right you told
      her yarns, and she&rsquo;d enjoy &rsquo;em more&rsquo;n you would
      yourself, which is saying something; but when you were off the track a bit
      you told her other things, and she&rsquo;d heave you on again. See her
      with the sick travellers!&rdquo; And then he stopped unexpectedly as his
      voice became thick and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp-fire conversations have a trick of coming to an abrupt end without
      embarrassing any one. As Dan sat looking into the fire, with his thoughts
      far away in the past, the M&#259;luka began to croon contentedly at
      &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rdquo; and, curled up in the warm, sweet nest of
      leaves, I listened to the crooning, and, watching the varying expression
      of Dan&rsquo;s face, wondered if Mrs. Bob had any idea of the bright
      memories she had left behind her in the bush. Then as the M&#259;luka
      crooned on, everything but the crooning became vague and indistinct, and,
      beginning also to see into the heart of things, I learned that when a
      woman finds love and comradeship out-bush, little else is needed to make
      even the glowing circle of a camp fire her home-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any warning the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s mood changed, &ldquo;There is
      nae luck aboot her house, there is nae luck at a&rsquo;,&rdquo; he shouted
      lustily, and Dan, waking from his reverie with a start, rose to the
      tempting bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&nbsp;<i>luck&nbsp;</i>about&nbsp;<i>her&nbsp;</i>house!&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;It was Mrs. Bob that had no luck. She struck a good,
      comfortable, well-furnished house first go off, and never got an ounce of
      educating. She was chained to that house as surely as ever a dog was
      chained to its kennel. But it&rsquo;ll never come to that with the missus.
      Something&rsquo;s bound to happen to Johnny, just to keep her from ever
      having a house. Poor Johnny, though,&rdquo; he added, warming up to the
      subject. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard luck for him. He&rsquo;s a decent little
      chap. We&rsquo;ll miss him&rdquo;; and he shook his head sorrowfully, and
      looked round for applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka said it seemed a pity that Johnny had been allowed to go
      to his fate; but Dan was in his best form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference,&rdquo; he said
      tragically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have got fever if he&rsquo;d stayed on, or a
      tree would have fallen on him. He&rsquo;s doomed if the missus keeps him
      to his contract.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! He&rsquo;ll die in a good cause,&rdquo; I said cheerfully
      and Dan&rsquo;s gravity deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the dead finish!&rdquo; he chuckled, and without
      further ceremony, beyond the taking off his boots, rolled into his
      mosquito net for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard nothing further from him until that strange rustling hour of the
      night&mdash;that hour half-way between midnight and dawn, when all nature
      stirs in its sleep, and murmurs drowsily in answer to some mysterious
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all bushmen who sleep with the warm earth for a bed will tell of
      this strange wakening moment, of that faint touch of half-consciousness,
      that whispering stir, strangely enough, only perceptible to the <i>sleeping</i>
      children of the bush&mdash;one of the mysteries of nature that no man can
      fathom, one of the delicate threads with which the Wizard of Never-Never
      weaves his spells. &ldquo;Is all well my children?&rdquo; comes the cry
      from the watchman of the night; and with a gentle stirring the answer
      floats back &ldquo;All is well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly the pine forest rustled with the call and the answer; and as the
      camp roused to its dim half-consciousness, Dan murmured sleepily, &ldquo;Sool&rsquo;em,
      old girl&rdquo; then after a vigorous rustling among the leaves (Sool&rsquo;em&rsquo;s
      tail returning thanks for the attention), everything slipped back into
      unconsciousness until the dawn. As the first grey streak of dawn filtered
      through the pines, a long-drawn out cry of &ldquo;Day-li-ght&rdquo;&mdash;Dan&rsquo;s
      camp reveille&mdash;rolled out of his net, and Dan rolled out after it,
      with even less ceremony than he had rolled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way back to the homestead, Dan suggesting that the &ldquo;missus
      might like to have a look at the dining-room,&rdquo; we turned into the
      towering timber that borders the Reach, and for the next two hours rode on
      through soft, luxurious shade; and all the while the fathomless spring-fed
      Reach lay sleeping on our left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reach always slept; for nearly twelve miles it lay, a swaying garland
      of heliotrope and purple water-lilies, gleaming through a graceful fringe
      of palms and rushes and scented shrubs, touched here and there with shafts
      of sunlight, and murmuring and rustling with an attendant host of gorgeous
      butterflies and flitting birds and insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan looked on the scene with approving eyes. &ldquo;Not a bad place to
      ride through, is it?&rdquo; he said. But gradually as we rode on a vague
      depression settled down upon us, and when Dan finally decided he &ldquo;could
      do with a bit more sunshine,&rdquo; we followed him into the blistering
      noontide glare with almost a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always so. These wondrous waterways have little part in that
      mystical holding power of the Never-Never. They are only pleasant places
      to ride through and&mdash;leave behind; for their purring slumberous
      beauty is vaguely suggestive of the beauty of a sleeping tiger:&mdash;a
      sleeping tiger with deadly fangs and talons hidden under a wonder of soft
      allurement; and when exiles in the towns sit and dream their dreams are
      all of stretches of scorched grass and quivering sun-flecked shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the honest sunlight Dan&rsquo;s spirits rose, and as I investigated
      various byways he asked &ldquo;where the sense came in tying-up a dog that
      was doing no harm running loose.&rdquo; &ldquo;It waren&rsquo;t as though
      she&rsquo;d taken to chivying cattle,&rdquo; he added, as, a mob of
      inquisitive steers trotting after us, I hurried Roper in among the riders;
      and then he wondered &ldquo;how she&rsquo;ll shape at her first muster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the morning he filled in with tales of cattle-musters tales of
      stampedes and of cattle rushing over camps and &ldquo;mincing chaps into
      saw-dust&rdquo; until I was secretly pleased that the coming muster was
      for horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack&rsquo;s reprieve was to last a little longer. When all was ready
      for the muster, word came in that outside blacks were in all along the
      river, and the M&#259;luka deciding that the risks were too great for the
      missus in long-grass country, the plans were altered, and I was left at
      the homestead in the Dandy&rsquo;s care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ill wind that blows nobody any good,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      said, drawing attention to Jack&rsquo;s sudden interest in the
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from sterling worth of character, the Dandy was all contrast to the
      Quiet Stockman: quick, alert, and sociable, and brimming over with quiet
      tact and thoughtfulness, and the M&#259;luka knew I was in good hands. But
      the Dandy had his work to attend to; and after watching till the bush had
      swallowed up the last of the pack-team, I went to the wood-heap for
      company and consolation. Had the Darwin ladies seen me then, they would
      have been justified in saying, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was plenty of company at the wood-heap, but the consolation was
      doubtful in character. Goggle-Eye and three other old black fellows were
      gossiping there, and after a peculiar grin of welcome, they expressed
      great fear lest the homestead should be attacked by &ldquo;outside&rdquo;
      blacks during the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s absence. &ldquo;Might it,&rdquo;
      they said, and offered to sleep in the garden near me, as no doubt &ldquo;missus
      would be frightened fellow&rdquo; to sleep alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me big mob frightened fellow longa wild black fellow,&rdquo;
      Goggle-Eye said, rather overdoing the part; and the other old rascals
      giggled nervously, and said &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; But sly, watchful
      glances made me sure they were only probing to find if fear had kept the
      missus at the homestead. Of course, if it had, a little harmless bullying
      for tobacco could be safely indulged in when the Dandy was busy at the
      yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Dan&rsquo;s system of education provided for all emergencies;
      and remembering his counsel to &ldquo;die rather than own to a black
      fellow that you were frightened of anything,&rdquo; I refused their offer
      of protection, and declared so emphatically that there was nothing in
      heaven or earth that I was afraid to tackle single-handed, that I almost
      believed it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt <i>they</i> believed it, for they murmured in
      admiration &ldquo;My word! Missus big mob cheeky fellow all right.&rdquo;
      But in their admiration they forgot that they were supposed to be quaking
      with fear themselves, and took no precautions against the pretended
      attack. &ldquo;Putting themselves away properly,&rdquo; the Dandy said
      when I told him about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a try-on all right,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Evidence was
      against you, but they struck an unexpected snag. You&rsquo;ll have to keep
      it up, though&rdquo;; and deciding &ldquo;there was nothing in the yarn,&rdquo;
      the Dandy slept in the Quarters, and I in the House, leaving the doors and
      windows open as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was reported at dawn by Billy Muck, who had taken no part in the
      intimidation scheme, a wholesome awe crept into the old men&rsquo;s
      admiration; for a black fellow is fairly logical in these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him, the man who crouches behind barred doors is a coward, and may be
      attacked without much risk, while he who relies only on his own strength
      appears as a Goliath defying the armies of a nation, and is best left
      alone, lest he develop into a Samson annihilating Philistines. Fortunately
      for my reputation, only the Dandy knew that we considered open doors
      easier to get out of than closed ones, and that my revolver was to be
      fired to call him from the Quarters if anything alarming occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to live up to your reputation now,&rdquo; the
      Dandy said, and, brave in the knowledge that he was within cooee, I
      ordered the old men about most unmercifully, leaving little doubt in their
      minds that &ldquo;missus was big mob cheeky fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were most deferential all day, and at sundown I completed my revenge
      by offering these rulers of a nation the insult of a woman&rsquo;s
      protection. &ldquo;If you are still afraid of the wild blacks, you may
      sleep near me to-night,&rdquo; I said, and apologised for not having made
      the offer for the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em on toast,&rdquo; the Dandy chuckled as
      the offer was refused with a certain amount of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lubras secretly enjoyed the discomfiture of their lords and masters,
      and taking me into their confidence, made it very plain that a lubra&rsquo;s
      life at times is anything but a happy one; particularly if &ldquo;me boy
      all day krowl (growl).&rdquo; As for the lords and masters themselves, the
      insult rankled so that they spent the next few days telling great and
      valiant tales of marvellous personal daring, hoping to wipe the stain of
      cowardice from their characters. Fortunately for themselves, Billy Muck
      and Jimmy had been absent from the wood-heap, and, therefore, not having
      committed themselves on the subject of wild blacks, bragged excessively.
      Had they been present, knowing the old fellows well, I venture to think
      there would have been no intimidation scheme floated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Dandy put it, &ldquo;altogether the time passed pleasantly,&rdquo;
      and when the M&#259;luka returned we were all on the best of terms, having
      reached the phase of friendship when pet names are permissible. The missus
      had become &ldquo;Gadgerrie&rdquo; to the old men and certain privileged
      lubras. What it means I do not know, excepting that it seemed to imply
      fellowship. Perhaps it meant &ldquo;old pal&rdquo; or &ldquo;mate,&rdquo;
      or, judging from the tone of voice that accompanied it, &ldquo;old girl,&rdquo;
      but more probably, like &ldquo;M&#259;luka,&rdquo; untranslatable. The M&#259;luka
      was always &ldquo;M&#259;luka &rdquo; to the old men, and to some of us
      who imitated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan came in the day after the M&#259;luka, and, hearing of our &ldquo;affairs,&rdquo;
      took all the credit of it to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just shows what a bit of educating&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The Dandy would have had a gay old time of it if I hadn&rsquo;t put
      you up to their capers&rdquo;; and I had humbly to acknowledge the truth
      of all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not promising well,&rdquo; he added,
      satisfied with my humility. &ldquo;If Johnny&rsquo;ll only stay away long
      enough, we&rsquo;ll have you educated up to doing without a house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week it seemed as though Johnny was aiding and abetting Dan in
      his scheme of education; for he sent in word that his &ldquo;cross-cut
      saw,&rdquo; or something equally important, had doubled up on him, and he
      was going back to Katherine to &ldquo;see about it straight off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter9" id="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before the mustered horses were drafted out, every one at the homestead,
      blacks, whites, and Chinese, went up to the stockyard to &ldquo;have a
      look at them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan was in one of his superior moods. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if she knows
      anything about horses,&rdquo; he said condescendingly, as the Quiet
      Stockman opened the mob up a little to show the animals to better
      advantage. &ldquo;Show us your fancy in this lot, missus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
      I said, affecting particular knowledge of the subject, and Jack wheeled
      with a quick, questioning look, suddenly aware that, after all, a woman&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>be
      only a fellow-man; and as I glanced from one beautiful animal to another
      he watched keenly, half expectant and half incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long to choose. In the foreground stood a magnificent
      brown colt, that caught and held the attention, as it watched every
      movement with ears shot forward, and nostrils quivering; and as I pointed
      it out Jack&rsquo;s boyish face lit up with surprise and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of luck!&rdquo; Dan cried, as usual withholding the benefit of
      the doubt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve picked Jack&rsquo;s fancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Jack himself who surprised every one, for, forgetting his
      monosyllables, he said with an indescribable ring of fellowship in his
      voice, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s picked out the best in the whole mob,&rdquo; and
      turned back to his world among the horses with his usual self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s come to Jack?&rdquo;
      he said; but seemed puzzled at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s answer that he was
      &ldquo;only getting educated.&rdquo; The truth is, that every man has his
      vulnerable point, and Jack&rsquo;s was horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the mob had been put through the yards, all the unbroken horses were
      given into the Quiet Stockman&rsquo;s care, and for the next week or two
      the stockyard became the only place of real interest; for the homestead,
      waiting for the Wet to lift, had settled down to store lists, fencing, and
      stud books.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the horses alone that were of interest at the yards; the calm,
      fearless, self-reliant man who was handling them was infinitely more so.
      Nothing daunted or disheartened him; and in those hours spent on the
      stockyard fence, in the shade of a spreading tree, I learnt to know the
      Quiet Stockman for the man he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any one would know the inner character of a fellow man, let him put him
      to horse-breaking, and he will soon know the best or the worst of him. Let
      him watch him handling a wild, unbroken colt, and if he is steadfast of
      purpose, just, brave, and true-hearted, it will all be revealed; but if he
      lacks self-restraint, or is cowardly, shifty, or mean-spirited, he will do
      well to avoid the test, for the horse will betray him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s horse-breaking was a battle for supremacy of mind over mind,
      not mind over matter a long course of careful training and schooling, in
      which nothing was broken, but all bent to the control of a master. To him
      no two horses were alike; carefully he studied their temperaments,
      treating each horse according to its nature&mdash;using the whip freely
      with some, and with others not at all; coercing, coaxing, or humouring, as
      his judgment directed. Working always for intelligent obedience, not cowed
      stupidity, he appeared at times to be almost reasoning with the brute
      mind, as he helped it to solve the problems of its schooling; penetrating
      dull stupidity with patient reiteration, or wearing down stubborn
      opposition with steady, unwavering persistence, and always rewarding
      ultimate obedience with gentle kindness and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step by step, the training proceeded. Submission first, then an
      establishment of perfect trust and confidence between horse and man,
      without which nothing worth having could be attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, in orderly succession the rest followed: toleration of
      handling, reining, mouthing, leading on foot, and on horseback and in due
      time saddling and mounting. One thing at a time and nothing new until the
      old was so perfected that when all was ready for the mounting&mdash;from a
      spectacular point of view&mdash;the mounting was generally disappointing.
      Just a little rearing and curvetting, then a quiet, trusting acceptance of
      this new order of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen horses were in hand at once, and, as with children at school,
      some quickly got ahead of the others, and every day the interest grew
      keener and keener in the individual character of the horses. At the end of
      a week Jack announced that he was &ldquo;going to catch the brown colt,&rdquo;
      next day. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be worth seeing,&rdquo; he said; and from the
      Quiet Stockman that was looked upon as a very pressing invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day of the draughting he had ceased altogether to avoid me, and
      in the days that followed had gradually realised that a horse could be
      more to a woman than a means of locomotion; and now no longer drew the
      line at conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we went up to the yards in the morning, the brown colt was in a small
      yard by itself, and Jack was waiting at the gate, ready for its &ldquo;catching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a laugh at the wild rush with which the colt avoided him, he shut
      himself into the yard with it, and moved quietly about, sometimes towards
      it and sometimes from it; at times standing still and looking it over, and
      at other times throwing a rope or sack carelessly down, waiting until his
      presence had become familiar, and the colt had learned that there was
      nothing to fear from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious calmness in the man&rsquo;s movements, a fearless
      repose that utterly ignored the wild rushes, and as a natural result they
      soon ceased; and within just a minute or two the beautiful creature was
      standing still, watching in quivering wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually a double rope began to play in the air with ever-increasing
      circles, awakening anew the colt&rsquo;s fears; and as these in turn
      subsided, without any apparent effort a long running noose flickered out
      from the circling rope, and, falling over the strong young head, lay still
      on the arching neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leap forward was terrific; but the rope brought the colt up with a
      jerk; and in the instant&rsquo;s pause that followed the Quiet Stockman
      braced himself for the mad rearing plunges that were coming. There was
      literally only an instant&rsquo;s pause, and then with a clatter of hoofs
      the plungings began, and were met with muscles of iron, and jaw set like a
      vice, as the man, with heels dug into the ground dragged back on the rope,
      yielding as much as his judgment allowed&mdash;enough to ease the shocks,
      but not an inch by compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice the rearing, terrified creature circled round him and then the rope
      began to shorten to a more workable length. There was no haste, no flurry.
      Surely and steadily the rope shortened (but the horse went to the man not
      the man to the horse; that was to come later). With the shortening of the
      rope the compelling power of the man&rsquo;s will forced itself into the
      brute mind, and, bending to that will, the wild leaps and plungings took
      on a vague suggestion of obedience&mdash;a going&nbsp;<i>with&nbsp;</i>the
      rope, not against it; that was all. An erratic going, perhaps, but enough
      to tell that the horse had acknowledged a master. That was all Jack asked
      for at first, and, satisfied, he relaxed his muscles, and as the rope
      slackened the horse turned and faced him; and the marvel was how quickly
      it was all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something was to follow, that once seen could never be forgotten the&mdash;advance
      of the man to the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      With barely perceptible movement, the man&rsquo;s hands stole along the
      rope at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Never hurrying never stopping, they slid on,
      the colt watching them as though mesmerised. When within reach of the
      dilated nostrils, they paused and waited, and slowly the sensitive head
      came forward snuffing, more in bewilderment than fear at this new wonder,
      and as the dark twitching muzzle brushed the hands, the head drew sharply
      back, only to return again in a moment with greater confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four times the quivering nostrils came back to the hands before
      they stirred, then one lifted slowly and lay on the muzzle, warm and
      strong and comforting, while the other, creeping up the rope, slipped on
      to the glossy neck, and the catching was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while there was some gentle patting and fondling, to a
      murmuring accompaniment of words; the horse standing still with twitching
      ears the while. Then came the test of the victory&mdash;the test of the
      man&rsquo;s power and the creature&rsquo;s intelligence. The horse was to
      go to the man, at the man&rsquo;s bidding alone, without force or
      coercion. &ldquo;The better they are the sooner you learn &rsquo;em that,&rdquo;
      was one of Jack&rsquo;s pet theories, while his proudest boast&mdash;his
      only boast&mdash;perhaps was that he&rsquo;d &ldquo;never been beaten on
      that yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have to come sooner or later if you stick at &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
      he had said, when I marvelled at first to see the great creatures come
      obediently to the click of his tongue or fingers. So far in all his wide
      experience the latest had been the third day. That, however, was rare;
      more frequently it was a matter of hours, sometimes barely an hour, while
      now and then&mdash;incredulous as it may seem to the layman&mdash;only
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes before Jack put the brown colt to the test it had been a wild,
      terrified, plunging creature, and yet, as he stepped back to try its
      intelligence and submission, his face was confident and expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving slowly backwards, he held out one hand&mdash;the hand that had
      proved all kindness and comfort&mdash;and, snapping a finger and thumb,
      clicked his tongue in a murmur of invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown ears shot forward to attention at the sound, and as the head
      reached out to investigate, the snapping fingers repeated the invitation,
      and without hesitation the magnificent creature went forward obediently
      until the hand was once more resting on the dark muzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trusting beauty of the surrender seemed to break some spell that had
      held us silent since the beginning of the catching. &ldquo;Oh, Jack! Isn&rsquo;t
      he a beauty?&rdquo; I cried unconsciously putting my admiration into a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack no longer objected to questions. He turned towards us with soft,
      shining eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not many like him,&rdquo; he said,
      pulling at one of the flexible ears. &ldquo;You could learn him anything.&rdquo;
      It seemed so, for after trying to solve the problem of the roller and bit
      with his tongue when it was put into his mouth, he accepted the mystery
      with quiet, intelligent trust; and as soon as he was freed from it, almost
      courted further fondling. He would let no one but Jack near him, though.
      When we entered the yard the ears went back and the whites of the eyes
      showed. &ldquo;No one but me for a while,&rdquo; Jack said, with a strange
      ring of ownership in his voice, telling that it is a good thing to have a
      horse that is yours, and yours only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week &ldquo;Brownie&rdquo; was mounted, and ridden down to the
      House for final inspection, before &ldquo;going bush&rdquo; to learn the
      art of rounding up cattle. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll let you touch him now,&rdquo;
      Jack said; and after a snuffing inquiry at my hands the beautiful creature
      submitted to their caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan looked at him with approving eyes. &ldquo;To think she had the luck to
      choose him too, out of all that crowd,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i> always call it instinct, I think,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      said teasingly, twitting me on one of my pet theories, and the Dandy
      politely suggested &ldquo;It might be knowledge.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Quiet Stockman gave his opinion, making it very clear that he no
      longer felt that women had nothing in common with men. &ldquo;It never <i>is</i>
      anything <i>but</i> instinct,&rdquo; he said, with quiet decision in his
      voice. &ldquo;No one ever <i>learns</i> horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Quiet Stockman had been busy rearranging his ideas of womankind,
      a good many things had been going wrong at the homestead. Sam began by
      breaking both china cups, and letting the backbone slip out of everything
      in his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowls laid-out and eggs became luxuries. Cream refused to rise on the
      milk. It seemed impossible to keep meat sweet. Jimmy lost interest in the
      gathering of firewood and the carrying of water; and as a result, the
      waterbutts first shrank, then leaked, and finally lay down, a medley of
      planks and iron hoops. A swarm of grasshoppers passed through the
      homestead, and to use Sam&rsquo;s explicit English: &ldquo;Vegetable bin
      finissem all about&rdquo;; and by the time fresh seeds were springing the
      Wet returned with renewed vigour, and flooded out the garden. Then stores
      began to fail, including soap and kerosene, and writing-paper and ink
      threatened to &ldquo;peter out.&rdquo; After that the lubras, in a private
      quarrel during the washing of clothes, tore one of the &ldquo;couple of
      changes&rdquo; of blouses sadly; and the mistress of a cattle-station was
      obliged to entertain guests at times in a pink cambric blouse patched with
      a washed calico flour-bag; no provision having been made for patching.
      Then just as we were wondering what else could happen, one night, without
      the slightest warning, the very birds migrated from the lagoon, carrying
      away with them the promise of future pillows, to say nothing of a
      mattress, and the M&#259;luka was obliged to go far afield in search of
      non-migrating birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan wagged his head and talked wise philosophy, with these disasters for
      the thread of his discourse; but even he was obliged to own that there was
      a limit to education when Sam announced that &ldquo;Tea bin finissem all
      about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found that the last eighty-pound tea-chest contained tinware when
      he opened it to replenish his teacaddy. Tea had been ordered, and the
      chest was labelled tea clearly enough, to show that the fault lay in
      Darwin; but that was poor consolation to us, the sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessities of the bush are few; but they are necessities; and Billy
      Muck was sent in to the Katherine post-haste, to beg, borrow, or buy tea
      from Mine Host. At the least a horseman would take six days for the trip,
      irrespective of time lost in packing up; but knowing Billy&rsquo;s
      untiring, swinging stride, we hoped to see him within four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy left at midday, and we drank our last cup of tea at supper; the next
      day learned what slaves we can be to our bodies. Because we lacked tea,
      the interest went out of everything. Listless and unsatisfied, we sat
      about and developed headaches, not thirsty&mdash;for there was water in
      plenty&mdash;but craving for the uplifting influence of tea. Never
      drunkards craved more intensely for strong drink! Sam made coffee; but
      coffee only increased the headaches and cravings, and so we sat peering
      into the forest, hoping for travellers; and all we learnt by the
      experience was that tea is a necessary of life out-bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second evening a traveller came in from the south track. &ldquo;He
      wouldn&rsquo;t refuse a woman, surely,&rdquo; every one said, and we
      welcomed him warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had about three ounces of tea. &ldquo;Meant to fill up here meself,&rdquo;
      he said in apology, as, with the generosity of a bushman, he offered it
      all unconditionally. Let us hope the man has been rewarded, and has never
      since known what it is to be tealess out-bush! We never heard his name,
      and I doubt if any one of us would know the man again if we saw him. All
      we saw was a dingy tuckerbag, with its one corner bulging heart-shaped
      with tea!
    </p>
    <p>
      We accepted one half, for the man had a three-days, journey before him,
      and Sam doled it out so frugally that we spent two comparatively happy
      days before fixing our attention on the north track, along which Billy
      would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In four and a half days he appeared, carrying a five-pound tea-tin on his
      head, and was hailed with a yell of delight. We were all in the stockyard,
      and Billy, in answer to the hail, came there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan wanted a &ldquo;sniff of it right off,&rdquo; so it was then and there
      opened; but as the lid flew back the yell of delight changed to a howl of
      disappointment. By some hideous mistake, Billy had brought&nbsp;<i>raisins</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many philosophers, Dan could not apply his philosophy to himself.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dead finish,&rdquo; he said dejectedly; &ldquo;never
      struck anything like it before. Twice over too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;First
      tinware and now this foolery&rdquo;; and he kicked savagely at the
      offending tin, sending a shower of raisins dancing out into the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one but Dan was speechless, while Billy, not being a slave to
      tea-drinking, gathered the raisins up, failing to see any cause for
      disappointment, particularly as most of the raisins fell to his share for
      his prompt return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also failed to see any advantage in setting out again for the
      Katherine. &ldquo;Might it catch raisins nuzzer time,&rdquo; he said,
      logically enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan became despondent at the thought. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fools enough
      for anything,&rdquo; he said. I tried to cheer him up on the law of
      averages, as Goggle-Eye was sent off with instructions to travel &ldquo;quick-fellow,
      quick-fellow, big mob quick-fellow,&rdquo; and many promises of reward if
      he was back in &ldquo;four fellow sleeps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For two more days we peered into the forest for travellers but none
      appeared, and Dan became retrospective. &ldquo;We might have guessed this
      &rsquo;ud happen,&rdquo; he said, declaring it was a &ldquo;judgment on
      the missus&rdquo; for chucking good tea away just because a fly got into
      it. &ldquo;Luck&rsquo;s cleared right out because of it, missus,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;and if things go on like this Johnny&rsquo;ll be coming along
      one of these days.&rdquo; (Dan was the only one of us who could joke on
      the matter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luck&rsquo;s smashed all to pieces,&rdquo; he insisted later, when
      he found that the first pillow was finished; but at sundown was inclined
      to think it might be &ldquo;on the turn again,&rdquo; for Goggle-Eye
      appeared on the north track, stalking majestically in front of a horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me bin catch traveller,&rdquo; he said triumphantly, claiming his
      rewards, &ldquo;Me bin come back two fellow sleep&rdquo;; and before we
      could explain <i>that</i> was hardly what we had meant, the man had ridden
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you were doing a famish here, sitting with your tongues
      hanging out,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve brought you a few
      more raisins.&rdquo; And dismounting, he drew out from a pack-bag a long
      calico bag containing quite ten pounds of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You struck the Wag&rsquo;s tin,&rdquo; he said, explaining the
      mistake, as every one shouted for Sam to boil a kettle instantly, and with
      the tea came a message from the Wag himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you for my raisins&rdquo;; and we could almost
      hear the Wag&rsquo;s slow, dry chuckle underlying the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine Host also sent a message, saying he would &ldquo;send further
      supplies every opportunity, to keep things going until the waggons came
      through,&rdquo; and underlying <i>his</i> message we felt his kindly
      consideration. As a further proof of his thoughtfulness we found two china
      cups imbedded in the tea. He had heard of Sam&rsquo;s accident. Tea in
      china cups! and as much and as strong as we desired. But in spite of Mine
      Host&rsquo;s efforts to keep us going, twice again, before the waggons
      came, we found ourselves begging tea from travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our energies revived with the very first cup of tea, and we went for our
      usual evening stroll through the paddocks, with all our old appreciation;
      and on our return found the men stretched out on the grass beyond the
      Quarters, optimistic and happy, sipping at further cups of tea. (Sam&rsquo;s
      kettle was kept busy that night.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The men&rsquo;s optimism was infectious, and presently the M&#259;luka
      &ldquo;supposed the waggons would be starting before long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only March, and the waggons had to wait till the Wet lifted; but
      just then every one felt sure that &ldquo;the Wet would lift early this
      year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally does with the change of moon before Easter,&rdquo; the
      traveller said, and, flying off at a tangent, I asked when Easter was,
      unwittingly setting the homestead a tough problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody &ldquo;could say for certain.&rdquo; But Dan &ldquo;knew a chap
      once who could reckon it by the moon&rdquo; and the M&#259;luka felt
      inspired to work it out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The first Friday&mdash;or is it Sunday?&mdash;<i>afte</i>r the
      first full moon,&nbsp;<i>after&nbsp;</i>the twenty-first of March.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-fifth, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the Dandy asked, complicating
      matters from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller reckoned it&rsquo;d be new moon about Monday or Tuesday,
      which seemed near enough at the time; and full moon was fixed for the
      Tuesday or Wednesday fortnight from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to settle it,&rdquo; Dan said; and so it might have if
      any one had been sure of Monday&rsquo;s date; but we all had different
      convictions about that, varying from the ninth to the thirteenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much ticking off of days upon fingers, with an old newspaper as
      &ldquo;something to work from,&rdquo; the date of the full moon was fixed
      for the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of March, unless the moon came in so
      late on Tuesday that it brought the full to the morning of the
      twenty-sixth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems getting a bit mixed,&rdquo; Dan said, and matters were
      certainly complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to reckon from the twenty-first, Easter was in March, but if
      from the twenty-fifth, in April&mdash;if the moon came in on Monday, but
      March in either case if the full was on the twenty-sixth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan suggested &ldquo;giving it best.&rdquo; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud get
      anybody dodged,&rdquo; he said, hopelessly at sea; but the M&#259;luka
      wanted to &ldquo;see it through.&rdquo; &ldquo;The new moon should clear
      most of it up,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve given us a teaser
      this time, little &rsquo;un.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new moon should have cleared everything up if we could have seen it,
      but the Wet coming on in force again, we saw nothing till Thursday
      evening, when it was too late to calculate with precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan was for having two Easters, and &ldquo;getting even with it that way&rdquo;;
      but Sam unexpectedly solved the problem for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the difficulty?&rdquo; he asked, and listened to the
      explanation attentively. &ldquo;Bunday!&rdquo; he exclaimed at the finish,
      showing he had fully grasped the situation. Of course he knew all about
      Bunday! Wasn&rsquo;t it so many weeks after the Chinaman&rsquo;s New Year
      festival? And in a jargon of pidgin-English he swept aside all moon
      discussions, and fixed the date of &ldquo;Bunday&rdquo; for the
      twenty-eighth of March, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; as Dan wisely remarked,
      &ldquo;proved that somebody was right,&rdquo; but whether the M&#259;luka
      or the Dandy, or the moon, he forgot to specify. &ldquo;The old heathen to
      beat us all too,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;just when it had got us all
      dodged.&rdquo; Dan took all the credit of the suggestion to himself. Then
      he looked philosophically on the toughness of the problem: &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;the missus must have learnt a bit about beginning at the
      beginning of things. Just think what she&rsquo;d have missed if any one
      had known when Easter was right off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What she&rsquo;d have missed indeed. Exactly what the townsman
      misses, as long as he remains in a land where everything can be known
      right off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a new idea had come to Dan. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
      far as that goes, if Johnny does turn up she ought to learn a thing or
      two, while he&rsquo;s moving the dining-room up the house&rdquo;; and he
      decided to welcome Johnny on his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not long to wait, for in a day or two Johnny rode into the
      homestead, followed by a black boy carrying a cross-cut saw. This time he
      hailed us with a cheery:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now&nbsp;</i>we shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter10" id="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had taken over six weeks to &ldquo;get hold of little Johnny&rdquo;;
      but as the Dandy had prophesied, once he started, he &ldquo;made things
      hum in no time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; he said, flourishing a tape
      measure; and the Dandy was kept busy for half a day, &ldquo;wrestling with
      the calculating.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That finished, the store was turned inside out and a couple of &ldquo;boys&rdquo;
      sent in for &ldquo;things needed,&rdquo; and after them more &ldquo;boys&rdquo;
      for more things; and then other &ldquo;boys&rdquo; for other things, until
      travellers must have thought the camp blacks had entered into a walking
      competition. When everything necessary was ordered, &ldquo;all hands&rdquo;
      were put on to sharpen saws and tools, and the homestead shrieked and
      groaned all day with harsh, discordant raspings. Then a camp was pitched
      in the forest, a mile or so from the homestead; a sawpit dug, a platform
      erected, and before a week had passed an invitation was issued, for the
      missus to &ldquo;come and see a tree felled.&rdquo; &ldquo;Laying the
      foundation-stone,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny of course welcomed us with a jovial &ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t be
      long,&rdquo; and shouldering a tomahawk, led the way out of the camp into
      the timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      House-hunting in town does not compare favourably with timber-hunting for
      a house, in a luxuriant tropical forest. Sheltered from the sun and heat
      we wandered about in the feathery undergrowth, while the M&#259;luka
      tested the height of the giant timber above us with shots from his
      bull-dog revolver bringing down twigs and showers of leaves from the topmost
      branches, and sending flocks of white cockatoos up into the air with
      squawks of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tree after tree was chosen and marked with the tomahawk, each one
      appearing taller and straighter and more beautiful than any of its fellows
      until, finding ourselves back at the camp, Johnny went for his axe and
      left us to look at the beauty around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems a pity to spoil all this, just to make four walls to shut the
      missus in from anything worth looking at,&rdquo; Dan murmured as Johnny
      reappeared. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t make anything as good as this up at
      the house.&rdquo; Johnny the unpoetical hesitated, perplexed. Philosophy
      was not in his line. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t too bad,&rdquo; he said,
      suddenly aware of the beauty of the scene, and then the tradesman came to
      the surface. &ldquo;I reckon&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;job&rsquo;ll be a bit
      more on the plumb, though,&rdquo; he chuckled, and, delighted with his
      little joke, shouldered his axe and walked towards one of the marked
      trees, while Dan speculated aloud on the chances a man had of &ldquo;getting
      off alive&rdquo; if a tree fell on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trees don&rsquo;t fall on a man that knows how to handle timber,&rdquo;
      the unsuspecting Johnny said briskly; and as Dan feared that &ldquo;fever
      was her only chance then,&rdquo; he spat on his hands, and, sending the
      axe home into the bole of the tree with a clean, swinging stroke, laid the
      foundation-stone&mdash;the foundation-stone of a tiny home in the
      wilderness, that was destined to be the dwelling-place of great joy, and
      happiness, and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanguine Scot had prophesied rightly. There being &ldquo;time enough
      for everything in the Never-Never,&rdquo; there was time for &ldquo;many
      pleasant rides along the Reach, choosing trees for timber.&rdquo;

    <p>
      But the rides were the least part of the pleasure. For the time being, the
      silent Reach forest had become the hub of our little universe. All was
      life and bustle and movement there. Every day fresh trees were felled and
      chopping contests entered into by Johnny and the Dandy; and as the trees
      fell in quick succession, black boys and lubras armed with tomahawks,
      swarmed over them, to lop away the branches, before the trunks were
      dragged by the horses to the mouth of the sawpit. Every one was happy and
      light-hearted, and the work went merrily forward, until a great pile of
      tree-trunks lay ready for the sawpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a new need arose: Johnny wanted several yards of strong string, and a
      &ldquo;sup&rdquo; of ink, to make guiding lines on the timber for his saw;
      but as only sewing cotton was forthcoming, and the M&#259;luka refused to
      part with one drop of his precious ink, we were obliged to go down to the
      beginning of things once more: two or three lubras were set to work to
      convert the sewing-cotton into tough, strong string, while others prepared
      a substitute for the ink from burnt water-lily roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sawing of the tree-trunks lasted for nearly three weeks, and the
      Dandy, being the under-man in the pit, had anything but a merry time. Down
      in the pit, away from the air, he worked; pulling and pushing, pushing and
      pulling, hour after hour, in a blinding stream of sawdust.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we offered him sympathy and a gossamer veil, he accepted the veil
      gratefully, but waved the sympathy aside, saying it was &ldquo;all in the
      good cause.&rdquo; Nothing was ever a hardship to the Dandy, excepting
      dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny being a past-master in his trade, stood on the platform in the
      upper air, guiding the saw along the marked lines; and as he instructed us
      all in the fine art of pit-sawing, Dan decided that the building of a
      house, under some circumstances, could be an education in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought she might manage to learn a thing or two out of it,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;The building of it is right enough. It all depends what
      she uses it for when Johnny&rsquo;s done with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the pliant saw coaxed beams, and slabs, and flooring boards out of the
      forest trees I grew to like beginning at the beginning of things, and
      realised there was an underlying truth in Dan&rsquo;s whimsical
      reiteration, that &ldquo;the missus was in luck when she struck this place&rdquo;;
      for beams and slabs and flooring boards wrested from Nature amid
      merrymaking and philosophical discourses are not as other beams and slabs
      and flooring boards. They are old friends and fellow-adventurers, with
      many a good tale to tell, recalling comical situations in their
      reminiscences with a vividness that baffles description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps those who live in homes with the beginning of things left behind
      in forests they have never seen, may think chattering planks a poor
      compensation for unpapered, rough-boarded walls and unglazed window
      frames. Let them try it before they judge; remembering always, that before
      a house can be built of old friends and memories the friends must be made
      and the memories lived through.
    </p>
    <p>
      But other things beside the sawing of timber were in progress, Things were
      also &ldquo;humming&rdquo; in the dog world. A sturdy fox-terrier, Brown
      by name, had been given by a passing traveller to the M&#259;luka, given
      almost of necessity for Brown&mdash;as is the way with fox-terriers at
      times&mdash;quietly changed masters, and lying down at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      feet, had refused to leave him. The station dogs resented his presence
      there, and persecuted him as an interloper; and being a peace-loving dog,
      Brown bore it patiently for two days, hoping, no doubt, the persecution
      would wear itself out. On the third day, however, he quietly changed his
      tactics&mdash;for sometimes the only road to peace is through fighting&mdash;and,
      accepting their challenge, took on the station dogs one by one in single
      combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a full-sized particularly sturdy-looking fox-terrier against expert
      cattle dogs; and yet no dog could stand against him. One by one he closed
      with them, and one by one they went before him; and at the end of a week
      he was &ldquo;cock of the walk,&rdquo; and lay down to enjoy his
      well-earned peace. His death-stroke was a flashing lunge, from a grip of a
      foreleg to a sharp, grinding grip of the enemy&rsquo;s tongue. How he
      managed it was a puzzle, but sooner or later he got his grip in, to let go
      at the piercing yell of defeat that invariably followed. But Brown was a
      gentleman, not a bully, and after each fight buried the hatchet, appearing
      to shake hands with his late adversary. No doubt if he had had a tail he
      would have wagged it, but Brown had been born with a large, perfectly
      round, black spot, at the root of his tail, and his then owner, having an
      eye for the picturesque, had removed his white tail entirely, even to its
      last joint, to allow of no break in the spot; and when the spirit moved
      Brown to wag a tail, a violent stirring of hairs in the centre of this
      spot betrayed his desire to the world. It goes without saying that Brown
      did not fight the canine women-folk; for, as some one has said, man is the
      only animal that strikes his women-folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the battles were fought in the station thoroughfare, all of them
      taking on the form of a general m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. As soon as Brown
      closed with an enemy, the rest of the dogs each sought an especial
      adversary, hoping to wipe out some past defeat; while the pups, having no
      past to wipe out, diverted themselves by skirmishing about on the
      outskirts of the scrimmage, nipping joyously at any hind quarters that
      came handy, bumping into other groups of pups, thoroughly enjoying life,
      and accumulating material for future fights among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether we had a lively week. To interfere in the fights only prolonged
      them; and, to add to the general hubbub, the servant question had opened
      up again. Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie, who had been simmering for some time,
      suddenly rebelled, and refused to consider herself among the rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said there was no vacancy on the staff for her, and she immediately set
      herself to create one, by pounding and punching at the staff in private.
      Finding this of no avail, she threatened to &ldquo;sing&rdquo; Maudie
      dead, also in private, unless she resigned. Maudie proving unexpectedly
      tough and defiant, Nellie gave up all hope of creating a vacancy, and
      changing front, adopted a stone-walling policy. Every morning, quietly and
      doggedly, she put herself on the staff, and every morning was as quietly
      and doggedly dismissed from office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doggedness being an unusual trait in a black fellow, the homestead became
      interested. &ldquo;Never say die, little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      laughed each morning; but Dan was inclined to bet on Nellie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got nothing else to do, and can concentrate all her
      thoughts on it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and besides, it means more for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It meant a good deal to me, too, for I particularly objected to Jimmy&rsquo;s
      Nellie partly because she was an inveterate smoker and a profuse spitter
      upon floors; partly because&mdash;well to be quite honest&mdash;because a
      good application of carbolic soap would have done no harm; and partly
      because she appeared to have a passion for exceedingly scanty garments,
      her favourite costume being a skirt made from the upper half of a
      fifty-pound calico flour bag. Her blouses had, apparently, been all
      mislaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie, unconscious of my real objections, daily and doggedly put herself
      on the staff, and was daily and doggedly dismissed. But as she generally
      managed to do the very thing that most needed doing, before I could find
      her to dismiss, Dan was offering ten to one on Nellie by Easter time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another moon&rsquo;ll see her on the staff,&rdquo; he prophesied,
      as we prepared to go out-bush for Easter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Easter moon had come in dry and cool, and at its full the Wet lifted,
      as our traveller had foretold. Only a bushman&rsquo;s personal
      observation, remember, this lifting of the Wet with the full of the Easter
      moon, not a scientific statement; but by an insight peculiarly their own,
      bushmen come at more facts than most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam did his best with Bunday, serving hot rolls with mysterious markings
      on them for breakfast, and by midday he had the homestead to himself, the
      M&#259;luka and I being camped at Bitter Springs and every one else being
      elsewhere. Our business was yard-inspection, with Goggle-Eye as general
      factotum. We, of course, had ridden out, but Goggle-Eye had preferred to
      walk. &ldquo;Me all day knock up longa horse,&rdquo; he explained striding
      comfortably along beside us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several exciting hours were spent with boxes of wax matches, burning the
      rank grass back from the yard at the springs (at Goggle-Eye&rsquo;s
      suggestion the missus had been pressed into the service); and then we rode
      through the rank grass along the river, scattering matches as we went like
      sparks from an engine. As soon as the rank grass seeds it must be burnt
      off, before the soil loses its moisture, to ensure a second shorter
      spring, and everywhere we went now clouds of dense smoke rose behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      That walk about with the M&#259;luka and &ldquo;Gadgerrie&rdquo; lived
      like a red-letter day in old Goggle-Eye&rsquo;s memory; for did he not
      himself strike a dozen full boxes of matches?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan was away beyond the northern boundary, going through the cattle,
      judging the probable duration of &ldquo;outside waters&rdquo; for that
      year, burning off too as he rode. The Quiet Stockman was away beyond the
      southern boundary, rounding up wanderers and stragglers among the horses,
      and the station was face to face with the year&rsquo;s work, making
      preparations for the year&rsquo;s mustering and branding&mdash;for with
      the lifting of the Wet everything in the Never-Never begins to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the Wet&rdquo; rivers go down, the north-west monsoon giving
      place to the south-east Trades; bogs dry up everywhere, opening all roads;
      travellers pass through the stations from all points of the compass&mdash;cattle
      buyers, drovers, station-owners, telegraph people&mdash;all bent on
      business, and all glad to get moving after the long compulsory inaction of
      the Wet; and lastly that great yearly cumbrous event takes place: the
      starting of the &ldquo;waggons,&rdquo; with their year&rsquo;s stores for
      Inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first batch of travellers had little news for us. They had heard that
      the teams were loading up, and couldn&rsquo;t say for certain, and,
      finding them unsatisfactory, we looked forward to the coming of the
      &ldquo;Fizzer,&rdquo; our mailman, who was almost due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight mails a year was our allowance, with an extra one now and then
      through the courtesy of travellers. Eight mails a year against eight
      hundred for the townsfolk. Was it any wonder that we all found we had
      business at the homestead when the Fizzer was due there?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came this trip he was, as usual, brimming over with news: personal
      items, public gossip, and the news that the horse teams had got most of
      their loading on, and that the Macs were getting their bullocks under way.
      Two horse waggons and a dray for far &ldquo;inside,&rdquo; and three
      bullock waggons for the nearer distances, comprised the &ldquo;waggons&rdquo;
      that year. The teamsters were Englishmen; but the bullock-punchers were
      three &ldquo;Macs&rdquo;&mdash;an Irishman, a Highlander, and the Sanguine
      Scot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six waggons, and about six months&rsquo; hard travelling, in and out, to
      provide a year&rsquo;s stores for three cattle stations and two telegraph
      stations. It is not surprising that the freight per ton was what it was&mdash;twenty-two
      pounds per ton for the Elsey, and upwards of forty pounds for &ldquo;inside.&rdquo;
      It is this freight that makes the grocery bill such a big item on stations
      out-bush, where several tons of stores are considered by no means a large
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close on the heels of the Fizzer came other travellers, with the news that
      the horse teams had got going and the Macs had &ldquo;pulled out&rdquo; to
      the Four Mile. &ldquo;Your trunks&rsquo;ll be along in no time now,
      missus,&rdquo; one of them said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em all
      aboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dandy did some rapid calculations: &ldquo;Ten miles a day on good
      roads,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;one hundred and seventy miles. Tens into
      that seventeen days. Give &rsquo;em a week over for unforeseen
      emergencies, and call it four weeks.&rdquo; It sounded quite cheerful and
      near at hand, but a belated thunderstorm or two, and consequent bogs,
      nearly doubled the four weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every day we heard news of the teams from the now constant stream
      of travellers; and by the time the timber was all sawn and carted to the
      house to fulfil the many promises there, they were at the Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the teams were at the Katherine, so were the teamsters, and so was
      the Pub; and when teamsters and a pub get together it generally takes time
      to separate them, when that pub is the last for over a thousand miles. One
      pub at the Katherine and another at Oodnadatta and between them over a
      thousand miles of bush, and desert and dust, and heat, and thirst. That,
      from a teamster&rsquo;s point of view, is the Overland Route from
      Oodnadatta to the Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pub had little attraction for the Sanguine Scot, and provided he could
      steer the other Macs safely past the one at the Katherine, there would be
      no delay there with the trunks; but the year&rsquo;s stores were on the
      horse teams and the station, having learnt bitter experience from the
      past, now sent in its own waggon for the bulk of the stores, as soon as
      they were known to be at the Katherine; and so the Dandy set off at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see me within a fortnight, bar accidents&rdquo; he
      called back, as the waggon lurched forward towards the slip-rails; and the
      pub also having little attraction for the Dandy, we decided to expect him,
      &ldquo;bar accidents.&rdquo; For that matter, a pub had little attraction
      for any of the Elsey men, the Quiet Stockman being a total abstainer, and
      Dan knowing &ldquo;how to behave himself,&rdquo; although he owned to
      having &ldquo;got a bit merry once or twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dandy out of sight, Johnny went back to his work, which happened to be
      hammering the curves out of sheets of corrugated iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; he shouted, hammering
      vigorously, and when I objected to the awful din, he reminded me, with a
      grin, that it was &ldquo;all in the good cause.&rdquo; When &ldquo;smoothed
      out,&rdquo; as Johnny phrased it, the iron was to be used for capping the
      piles that the house was built upon, &ldquo;to make them little white ants
      stay at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll smooth all your troubles out, if you give us time,&rdquo;
      he shouted, returning to the hammering after his explanation with even
      greater energy. But by dinnertime some one had waddled into our lives who
      was to smooth most of the difficulties out of it, to his own, and our
      complete satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Sam announced dinner a cloud of dust creeping along the horizon
      attracted our attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foot travellers!&rdquo; Dan decided; but something emerged out of
      the dust, as it passed through the sliprails, that looked very like a huge
      mould of white jelly on horse-back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly it sighted us it rolled off the horse, whether intentionally or
      unintentionally we could not say, and leaving the beast to the care of
      chance, unfolded two short legs from somewhere and waddled towards us&mdash;a
      fat, jovial Chinese John Falstaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, boss! Good day, missus! Good day, all about,&rdquo; he
      said in cheerful salute, as he trundled towards us like a ship&rsquo;s
      barrel in full sail. &ldquo;Me new cook, me&mdash;&rdquo; and then Sam
      appeared and towed him into port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blest!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, staring after him.
      &ldquo;What&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>we struck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Johnny knew, as did most Territorians. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve struck
      Cheon, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Talk of luck! He&rsquo;s
      the jolliest old josser going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;jolliest old josser&rdquo; seemed difficult to repress; for
      already he had eluded Sam, and, reappearing in the kitchen doorway,
      waddled across the thoroughfare towards us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me new cook!&rdquo; he repeated, going on from where he had left
      off. &ldquo;Me Cheon!&rdquo; and then, in queer pidgin-English, he
      solemnly rolled out a few of his many qualifications:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me savey all about,&rdquo; he chanted. &ldquo;Me savey cook &rsquo;im,
      and gard&rsquo;in&rsquo;, and milk &rsquo;im, and chuckie, and fishin&rsquo;
      and shootin&rsquo; wild duck.&rdquo; On and on he chanted through a varied
      list of accomplishments, ending up with an application for the position of
      cook. &ldquo;Me sit down? Eh boss?&rdquo; he asked, moon-faced and
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please yourself!&rdquo; the M&#259;luka laughed, and with a flash
      of white teeth and an infectious chuckle Cheon laughed and nodded back;
      then, still chuckling, he waddled away to the kitchen and took possession
      there, while we went to our respective dinners, little guessing that the
      truest-hearted, most faithful, most loyal old &ldquo;josser&rdquo; had
      waddled into our lives.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter11" id="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cheon rose at cock-crow (&ldquo;fowl-sing-out,&rdquo; he preferred to call
      it), and began his duties by scornfully refusing Sam&rsquo;s bland offer
      of instruction in the &ldquo;ways of the homestead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me savey all about,&rdquo; he said, with a majestic wave of his
      hands, after expressing supreme contempt for Sam&rsquo;s caste and ways;
      so Sam applied for his cheque, shook hands all round, and withdrew
      smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;s account being satisfactorily &ldquo;squared,&rdquo; Cheon&rsquo;s
      name was then formally entered in the station books as cook and gardener,
      at twenty-five shillings a week. That was the only vacancy he ever filled
      in the books; but in our life at the homestead he filled almost every
      vacancy that required filling, and there were many.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing he could not and did not do for our good, and it was
      well that he refused to be instructed in anybody&rsquo;s ways, for his own
      were delightfully disobedient and unexpected and entertaining. Not only
      had we &ldquo;struck the jolliest old josser going,&rdquo; but a born
      ruler and organiser into the bargain. He knew best what was good for us,
      and told us so, and, meekly bending to his will, our orders became mere
      suggestions to be entertained and carried out if approved of by Cheon, or
      dismissed as &ldquo;silly-fellow&rdquo; with a Podsnapian wave of his arm
      if they in no way appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of wrath for Sam&rsquo;s ways, and bubbling over with trundling
      energy, he calmly appropriated the whole staff, as well as Jimmy, Billy
      Muck, and the rejected, and within a week had put backbone into everything
      that lacked it, from the water-butts to old Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two days were spent in a whirlwind of dust and rubbish, turned
      out from unguessed-at recesses, and Cheon&rsquo;s jovial humour suiting
      his helpers to a nicety, the rubbish was dealt with amid shouts of delight
      and enjoyment; until Jimmy, losing his head in his lightness of heart, dug
      Cheon in the ribs, and, waving a stick over his head, yelled in mock
      fierceness: &ldquo;Me wild-fellow, black fellow. Me myall-fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cheon came out in a new r&ocirc;le. Without a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation his arms and legs appeared to fly out all together in Jimmy&rsquo;s
      direction, completely doubling him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me myall-fellow, too,&rdquo; Cheon said calmly, master of himself
      and the situation. Then, chuckling at Jimmy&rsquo;s discomfiture, he went
      on with his work, while his helpers stared open-eyed with amazement; an
      infuriated Chinese catherine-wheel being something new in the experience
      of a black fellow. It was a wholesome lesson, though, and no one took
      liberties with Cheon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rubbish disposed of, leaking water-butts, and the ruins of collapsed
      water-butts, were carried to the billabong, swelled in the water, hammered
      and hooped back into steadfast, reliable water-butts, and trundled along
      to their places in a merry, joyous procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Cheon&rsquo;s hand on the helm, cream rose on the milk from
      somewhere. The meat no longer turned sour. An expert fisherman was
      discovered among the helpers&mdash;one Bob by name. Cheon&rsquo;s shot-gun
      appeared to have a magnetic attraction for wild duck. A garden sprang up
      as by magic, grasshoppers being literally chased off the vegetables. The
      only thing we lacked was butter; and after a week of order and cleanliness
      and dazzlingly varied menus, we wondered how we had ever existed without
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no use trying to wriggle from under Cheon&rsquo;s foot once he put
      it down. At the slightest neglect of duty, lubras or boys were marshalled
      and kept relentlessly to their work until he was satisfied; and woe betide
      the lubras who had neglected to wash hands, and pail and cow, before
      sitting down to their milking. The very fowls that laid out-bush gained
      nothing by their subtlety. At the faintest sound of a cackle, a dosing
      lubra was roused by the point of Cheon&rsquo;s toe, as he shouted
      excitedly above her: &ldquo;Fowl sing out! That way! Catch &rsquo;im egg!
      Go on!&rdquo; pointing out the direction with much pantomime; and as the
      egg-basket filled to overflowing, he either chuckled with glee or
      expressed further contempt for Sam&rsquo;s ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his especial wrath was reserved for the fowl-roosts over his sleeping
      quarters. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;er matter! Fowl sit down close up
      kitchen!&rdquo; he growled in furious gutturals, whenever his eyes rested
      on them; and as soon as time permitted he mounted to the roof and, boiling
      over with righteous indignation, hurled the offending roosts into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      New roosts were then nailed to the branches of a spreading coolibar tree,
      a hundred yards or so to the north of the buildings, the trunk encircled
      with zinc to prevent snakes or wild cats from climbing into the roosts; a
      movable ladder staircase made, to be used by the fowls at bedtime, and
      removed as soon as they were settled for the night, lest the cats or
      snakes should make unlawful use of it (Cheon always foresaw every
      contingency); and finally, &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and lubras were marshalled
      to wean the fowls from their old love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the weaning took time, and proved most entertaining; and while the
      fowls were being taught by bitter experience to bend to Cheon&rsquo;s
      will, the homestead pealed with shoutings and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening the fun commenced about sundown, and the entire community
      assembled to watch it; for it was worth watching&mdash;fowls dodged, and
      scurried, and squawked, as the staff and the rejected, under Cheon&rsquo;s
      directions, chivied and danced and screamed between them and their desire,
      the lubras cheering to the echo every time one of the birds gave in, and
      stalked, cackling and indignant, up the ladder into the branches of the
      coolibar; or pursuing runaways that had outwitted them, in shrieking,
      pell-mell disorder, while Cheon, fat and perspiring, either shouted orders
      and cheered lustily, bounded wrathfully after both runaways and lubras, or
      collapsed, doubled up with uncontrollable laughter, at the squawk of
      amazement from fowls which, having gained their old haunt, had found Jimmy
      there waiting to receive them. As for ourselves, I doubt if we ever
      enjoyed anything better. A simple thing, perhaps, to amuse grown-up white
      folk&mdash;a fat, perspiring Chinaman, and eight or ten lubras chivying
      fowls; but it is this enjoyment of simple things that makes life in the
      Never-Never all it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busy as he was, Cheon found time to take the missus also under his ample
      wing, and protect her from everything&mdash;even herself. &ldquo;Him too
      muchee little fellow,&rdquo; he said to the M&#259;luka, to explain his
      attitude towards his mistress; and the M&#259;luka, chuckling, shamefully
      encouraged him in his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every suggestion the missus made was received with an amused: &ldquo;No
      good that way, missus! Me savey all about.&rdquo; Her methods with lubras
      were openly disapproved, and her gardening ridiculed to all comers:
      &ldquo;White woman no good, savey gard&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he reiterated, but
      was fated to apologise handsomely in that direction later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in other things the white woman was honoured as became her position
      as never Sam had honoured her. Without any discrimination, Sam had
      summoned all at meal-times with a booming teamster&rsquo;s bell, thus
      placing the gentry on a level with the Quarters; but as Cheon pointed out,
      what could be expected of one of Sam&rsquo;s ways and caste? It was all
      very well to ring a peremptory bell for the Quarters&mdash;its caste
      expected to receive and obey orders; but gentry should be graciously
      notified that all was ready, when it suited their pleasure to eat; and
      from the day of Sam&rsquo;s departure, the House was honoured with a
      sing-song: &ldquo;Din-ner! Boss! Mis-sus!&rdquo; at midday, with changes
      rung at &ldquo;Bress-fass&rdquo; or &ldquo;Suppar&rdquo;; and no written
      menu being at its service, Cheon supplied a chanted one, so that before we
      sat down to the first course we should know all others that were to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only disadvantage we could associate with his coming was that by some
      means Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie had got on to the staff. No one seemed to know
      when or how it had happened, but she was there, firmly established working
      better than any one else, and Dan was demanding payment of his bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon would not hear of her dismissal. She was his &ldquo;right hand,&rdquo;
      he declared; and so I interviewed Nellie and stated my objections in cold,
      brutal English, only to hate myself the next moment; for poor Nellie, with
      a world of longing in her eyes, professed herself more than willing to
      wear &ldquo;good fellow clothes&rdquo; <i>if she could get any</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missus got big mob,&rdquo; she suggested as a hint; and, although
      that was a matter of opinion and comparison, in remorse I recklessly gave
      her my only bath wrapper, and for weeks went to the bath in a mackintosh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie was also willing to use as much carbolic soap as the station could
      afford; but as the smoking and spitting proved more difficult to cope
      with, and I had discovered that I could do all the &ldquo;housework&rdquo;
      in less time than it took to superintend it, I made Cheon a present of the
      entire staff, only keeping a lien on it for the washing and scrubbing. The
      lubras, however, refused to be taken off my visitor&rsquo;s list and Cheon
      insisting on them waiting on the missus while she was attending to the
      housework, no one gained or lost by the transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon had a scheme all his own for dealing with the servant question: the
      M&#259;luka should buy a little Chinese maiden to wait on the missus.
      Cheon knew of one in Darwin, going cheap, for ten pounds, his&mdash;<i>cousin</i>&rsquo;s
      child. &ldquo;A real bargain!&rdquo; he assured the M&#259;luka, finding
      him lacking in enthusiasm; &ldquo;docile, sweet, and attentive,&rdquo; and
      yes,&mdash;Cheon was sure of that&mdash;&ldquo;devoted to the missus,&rdquo;
      and also a splendid pecuniary investment (Cheon always had an eye on the
      dollars). Being only ten years of age, for six years she could serve the
      missus, and would then bring at least eighty pounds in the Chinese
      matrimonial market in Darwin&mdash;Chinese wives being scarce there. If
      she grew up moon-faced, and thus &ldquo;good-looking,&rdquo; there seemed
      no end to the wealth she would bring us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took time to convince Cheon of the abolition of slavery throughout the
      Empire, and even when convinced, he was for buying the treasure and saying
      nothing about it to the Governor. It was not likely he would come in
      person to the Elsey, he argued, and, unless told, would know nothing about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another fat, roundabout, roly-poly of humanity was to settle the
      servant question finally, within a day or two. &ldquo;Larrikin&rdquo; had
      been visiting foreign parts at Wandin, towards the west, and returning
      with a new wife, stolen from one &ldquo;Jacky Big-Foot,&rdquo; presented
      her to the missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him Rosy!&rdquo; he said, thus introducing his booty and without
      further ceremony Rosy requested permission to &ldquo;sit down&rdquo; on
      the staff. Like Cheon she carried her qualifications on the tip of her
      tongue: &ldquo;Me savey scrub &rsquo;im, and sweep &rsquo;im, and wash
      &rsquo;im, and blue &rsquo;im, and starch &rsquo;im,&rdquo; she said
      glibly, with a flash of white teeth against a babyish pink tongue. She was
      wearing a freshly washed bright blue dress, hanging loosely from her
      shoulders, and looked so prettily jolly, clean, capable, and curly-headed,
      that I immediately made her housemaid and Head of the Staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; the M&#259;luka groaned, &ldquo;that makes four
      of them at it!&rdquo; But Rosy had appealed to me and I pointed out that
      it was a chance not to be missed and that she was worth the other three
      all put together. &ldquo;Life will be a perennial picnic,&rdquo; I said,
      &ldquo;with Rosy and Cheon at the head of affairs&rdquo;; and for once I
      prophesied correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosy, having been brought up among white folk, proved an adept little
      housemaid and Cheon looked with extreme favour upon her, and held her up
      as a bright and shining example to Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie. But the person
      Cheon most approved of at the homestead was Johnny; for not only had
      Johnny helped him in many of his wild efforts at carpentry, but was he not
      working in the good cause?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;er matter, missus only got one room?&rdquo;
      Cheon had said, angry with circumstances, and daily and hourly he urged
      Johnny to work quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter indeed!&rdquo; Johnny echoed, mimicking his
      furious gutturals, and sawing, planing, and hammering, with untiring
      energy, pointed out that he was doing his best to give her more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the progress slow with only one man at work, Cheon suggested the M&#259;luka
      might lend a hand in his spare time (station books being considered
      recreation); and when Dan came in with a mob of cattle from the Reach
      country, he hinted that cattle could wait, and that Dan could employ his
      time better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan also was out of patience with circumstances, and growled out that
      &ldquo;they&rsquo;d waited quite long enough as it was,&rdquo; for the
      work of the station was at a deadlock for want of stores. They had been
      sadly taxed by the needs of travellers, and we were down to our last
      half-bag of flour and sugar, and a terrifyingly small quantity of tea;
      soap, jams, fruits, kerosene, and all such had long been things of the
      past. The only food we had in quantities was meat, vegetables, and milk.
      Where we would have been without Cheon no one can tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To crown all, we had just heard that the Dandy was delayed in a bog with a
      broken shaft, but he eventually arrived in time to save the situation, but
      not before we were quite out of tea. He had little to complain of in the
      way of welcome when his great piled-up waggon lumbered into the homestead
      avenue and drew up in front of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse teams were close behind, the Dandy said, but Mac was &ldquo;having
      a gay time&rdquo; in the sandy country, and sent in a message to remind
      the missus that she was still in the Land of Wait-awhile. The reminder was
      quite unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also a message from Mine Host. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending a few
      cuttings for the missus,&rdquo; it read. Cuttings he called them, but the
      back of the waggon looked like a nurseryman&rsquo;s van; for all a-growing
      and a-blowing and waiting to be planted out, stood a row of flowering,
      well-grown plants in tins: crimson hibiscus, creepers, oleanders, and all
      sorts. A man is best known by his actions, and Mine Host best understood
      by his kindly thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The store was soon full to overflowing, and so was our one room, for
      everything ordered for the house had arrived&mdash;rolls of calico heavy
      and unbleached, mosquito netting, blue matting for the floors, washstand
      ware, cups and saucers, and dozens of smaller necessities piled in every
      corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be many idle hands round these parts for a while,&rdquo;
      a traveller said, looking round the congested room, and he was right, for
      having no sewing machine, a gigantic hand-sewing contract was to be faced.
      The ceilings of both rooms were to be calico, and a dozen or so of seams
      were to be oversewn for that, the strips of matting were to be joined
      together and bound into squares, and after that a herculean task
      undertaken: the making of a huge mosquito-netted dining-room, large enough
      to enclose the table and chairs, so as to ensure our meals in comfort&mdash;for
      the flies, like the poor, were to be with us always.
    </p>
    <p>
      This net was to be nearly ten feet square and twelve high, with a calico
      roof of its own drawn taut to the ceiling of the room, and walls of
      mosquito netting, weighted at the foot with a deep fold of calico, and
      falling from ceiling to floor, with a wide double overlapping curtain for
      a doorway. Imagine an immense four-poster bed-net, ten by ten by twelve,
      swung taut within a larger room, and a fair idea of the dining-net will
      have been formed. A room within a room, and within the inner room we hoped
      to find a paradise at mealtime in comparison to the purgatory of the last
      few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sewing did not end at that. The lubras&rsquo; methods of washing
      had proved most disastrous to my meagre wardrobe; and the resources of the
      homestead were taxed to the utmost to provide sufficient patching material
      to keep the missus even decently clothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for the waggons,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka sang cheerily every
      time he found me hunting in the store (unbleached calico or mosquito
      netting being unsuitable for patching).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon openly disapproved of this state of affairs, and was inclined to
      blame the M&#259;luka. A good husband usually provides his wife with
      sufficient clothing, he insinuated; but when he heard that further
      supplies were on the bullock waggons, he apologised, and as he waddled
      about kept one ear cocked to catch the first sound of the bullock bells.
      &ldquo;Bullocky jump four miles,&rdquo; he informed us; from which we
      inferred that the sound of the bells would travel four miles. Cheon&rsquo;s
      English generally required paraphrasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every day some fresh garment collapsed, and I bitterly regretted my
      recklessness in giving Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie the bath wrapper. Fortunately
      a holland dress was behaving beautifully. &ldquo;A staunch little beast,&rdquo;
      the M&#259;luka called it. That, however, had to be washed, every
      alternate day; and, fearing possible contingencies, I was beginning a
      dress of unbleached calico, when the M&#259;luka, busy among the stores,
      came on a roll of bright pink galatea ordered for lubras&rsquo; dresses,
      and brought it to the house in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harsh, crudely pink, galatea! Yet it was received as joyfully as ever a
      woman received a Paris gown; for although necessity may be the mother of
      invention, she more often brings thankful hearts into this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hank of coarse, bristling white braid was also unearthed from among the
      stores, and within three days the galatea had become a sturdy
      white-braided blouse and skirt, that promised to rival the &ldquo;staunch
      little beast&rdquo; in staunch-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was finished, Johnny and the Dandy had all the flooring
      boards down in the dining-room, and before the last nail was in, Cheon and
      the M&#259;luka had carried in every available stick of furniture, and
      spread it about the room to the greatest possible advantage. The walls
      were still unfinished, and doors and window frames gaped; but what did
      that matter? The missus had a dining-room, and as she presided at her
      supper-table in vivid pink and the pride of possession, Cheon looked as
      though he would have liked to shake hands with every one at once, but
      particularly with Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks A1,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said, alluding to the stiff,
      aggressive frock, and took me &ldquo;bush&rdquo; with him, wearing the
      blouse, and a holland riding skirt that had also proved itself a true,
      staunch friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan, the Quiet Stockman, and the Dandy, had already gone &ldquo;bush&rdquo;
      in different directions; for with the coming of the year&rsquo;s stores,
      horse-breaking, house-building, trunks and waggons had all stepped into
      their proper places&mdash;a very secondary one&mdash;and cattle had come
      to the front and would stay there, as far as the men were concerned until
      next Wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cattle, and cattle only, would be the work of the &ldquo;Dry.&rdquo; Dan
      and the Quiet Stockman, with a dozen or so of cattle &ldquo;boys&rdquo; to
      help them, had the year&rsquo;s musterings and brandings to get through;
      the Dandy would be wherever he was most needed; yard-building,
      yard-repairing, carting stores or lending a hand with mustering when
      necessity arose, while the M&#259;luka would be everywhere at once, in
      organisation if not in body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where runs are huge, and fenceless, and freely watered the year&rsquo;s
      mustering and branding is no simple task. Our cattle were scattered
      through a couple of thousand square miles of scrub and open timbered
      country, and therefore each section of the run had to be gone over again
      and again; each mob, when mustered, travelled to the nearest yard and
      branded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every available day of the Dry was needed for the work; but there is one
      thing in the Never-Never that refuses to take a secondary-place&mdash;the
      mailman; and at the end of a week we all found, once again, that we had
      business at the homestead; for six weeks had slipped away since our last
      mail-day, and the Fizzer was due once more.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter12" id="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Fizzer was due at sundown, and for the Fizzer to be due meant that the
      Fizzer would arrive, and by six o&rsquo;clock we had all got cricks in our
      necks, with trying to go about as usual, and yet keep an expectant eye on
      the north track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fizzer is unlike every type of man excepting a bush mail-man. Hard,
      sinewy, dauntless, and enduring, he travels day after day and month after
      month, practically alone&mdash;&ldquo;on me Pat Malone,&rdquo; he calls it&mdash;with
      or without a black boy, according to circumstances, and five trips out of
      his yearly eight throwing dice with death along his dry stages, and yet at
      all times as merry as a grig, and as chirrupy as a young grasshopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a light-hearted, &ldquo;So long, chaps,&rdquo; he sets out from the
      Katherine on his thousand-mile ride, and with a cheery &ldquo;What ho,
      chaps! Here we are again!&rdquo; rides in again within five weeks with
      that journey behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand miles on horseback, &ldquo;on me Pat Malone,&rdquo; into the
      Australian interior and out again, travelling twice over three long dry
      stages and several shorter ones, and keeping strictly within the
      Government time-limit, would be a life-experience to the men who set that
      limit if it wasn&rsquo;t a death-experience. &ldquo;Like to see one of
      &rsquo;em doing it &rsquo;emselves,&rdquo; says the Fizzer. Yet never a
      day late, and rarely an hour, he does it eight times a year, with a
      &ldquo;So long, chaps,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Here we are again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="page146" id="page146"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:75%;">

      <a href="images/page146.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Fizzer was due at sundown, and at sundown a puff of dust rose on the
      track, and as a cry of &ldquo;Mail oh!&rdquo; went up all round the
      homestead, the Fizzer rode out of the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! What ho! boys,&rdquo; he shouted in welcome, and the next
      moment we were in the midst of his clattering team of pack-horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five minutes everything was in confusion; horse bells and hobbles
      jingling and clanging, harness rattling, as horses shook themselves free,
      and pack-bags, swags, and saddles came to the ground with loud, creaking
      flops. Every one was lending a hand, and the Fizzer, moving in and out
      among the horses, shouted a medley of news and instructions and welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News? Stacks of it!&rdquo; he shouted. The Fizzer always shouted.
      &ldquo;The gay time we had at the Katherine! Here, steady with that
      pack-bag. It&rsquo;s breakables! How&rsquo;s the raisin market? Eh, lads!&rdquo;
      with many chuckles. &ldquo;Sore back here, fetch along the balsam. What
      ho, Cheon!&rdquo; as Cheon appeared and greeted him as an old friend.
      &ldquo;Heard you were here. You&rsquo;re the boy for my money. You&nbsp;<i>bally&nbsp;</i>ass!
      Keep &rsquo;em back from the water there.&rdquo; This last was for the
      black boy. It took discrimination to fit the Fizzer&rsquo;s remarks on to
      the right person. Then, as a pack-bag dropped at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      feet, he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the station lot, boss. Full bags,
      missus! Two on &rsquo;em. You&rsquo;ll be doing the disappearing trick in
      half a mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;half a mo&rsquo;&rdquo; the seals were broken, and the
      mail-matter shaken out on the ground. A cascade of papers, magazines, and
      books, with a fat, firm little packet of letters among them: forty letters
      in all&mdash;thirty of them falling to my lot&mdash;thirty fat, bursting
      envelopes, and in another &ldquo;half mo&rsquo;&rdquo; we had all slipped
      away in different directions&mdash;each with our precious mail matter&mdash;doing
      the &ldquo;disappearing trick&rdquo; even to the Fizzer&rsquo;s
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fizzer smiled amiably after the retreating figures, and then went to
      be entertained by Cheon. He expected nothing else. He provided feasts all
      along his route, and was prepared to stand aside while the bush-folk
      feasted. Perhaps in the silence that fell over the bush homes, after his
      mail-bags were opened, his own heart slipped away to dear ones, who were
      waiting somewhere for news of our Fizzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight mails&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>in a year is not all disadvantage.
      Townsfolk who have eight hundred tiny doses of mail-matter doled out to
      them, like men on sick diet can form little idea of the pleasure of that
      feast of &ldquo;full bags and two on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; for like thirsty
      camels we drank it all in&mdash;every drop of it&mdash;in long, deep,
      satisfying draughts. It may have been a disadvantage, perhaps, to have
      been so thirsty; but then only the thirsty soul knows the sweetness of
      slaking that thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a full hour&rsquo;s silence the last written sheet was laid down,
      and I found the M&#259;luka watching and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoyed your trip south, little &rsquo;un?&rdquo; he said, and I
      came back to the bush with a start, to find the supper dead cold. But then
      supper came every night and the Fizzer once in forty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of voices, Cheon bustled in. &ldquo;New-fellow tea, I
      think,&rdquo; he said, and bustled out again with the teapot (Cheon had
      had many years&rsquo; experience of bush mail-days), and in a few minutes
      the unpalatable supper was taken away, and cold roast beef and tomatoes
      stood in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, as we went for our evening stroll, we stayed for a little
      while where the men were lounging, and after a general interchange of news
      the Fizzer&rsquo;s turn came.
    </p>
    <p>
      News! He had said he had stacks of it, and he now bubbled over with it.
      The horse teams were &ldquo;just behind,&rdquo; and the Macs almost at the
      front gate. The Sanguine Scot? Of course he was all right: always was, but
      reckoned bullock-punching wasn&rsquo;t all it was cracked up to be;
      thought his troubles were over when he got out of the sandy country, but
      hadn&rsquo;t reckoned on the black soil flats. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be
      surprised if he took to punching something else besides bullocks before he&rsquo;s
      through with it,&rdquo; the Fizzer shouted, roaring with delight at the
      recollection of the Sanguine Scot in a tight place. On and on he went with
      his news, and for two hours afterwards, as we sat chewing the cud of our
      mail-matter, we could hear him laughing and shouting and &ldquo;chiacking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak he was at it again, shouting among his horses, as he culled
      his team of &ldquo;done-ups,&rdquo; and soon after breakfast was at the
      head of the south track with all aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, chaps,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;See you again half-past
      eleven four weeks&rdquo;; and by &ldquo;half-past eleven four weeks&rdquo;
      he would have carried his precious freight of letters to the yearning,
      waiting men and women hidden away in the heart of Australia, and be out
      again, laden with &ldquo;inside&rdquo; letters for the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all seasons of the year he calls the first two hundred miles of his
      trip a &ldquo;kid&rsquo;s game.&rdquo; &ldquo;Water somewhere nearly every
      day, and a decent camp most nights.&rdquo; And although he speaks of the
      next hundred and fifty as being a &ldquo;bit off during the Dry,&rdquo; he
      faces its seventy-five-mile dry stage, sitting loosely in the saddle, with
      the same cheery &ldquo;So long, chaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Five miles to &ldquo;get a pace up&rdquo;&mdash;a drink, and then that
      seventy-five miles of dry, with any &ldquo;temperature they can spare from
      other parts,&rdquo; and not one drop of water in all its length for the
      horses. Straight on top of that, with the same horses and the same
      temperature, a run of twenty miles, mails dropped at Newcastle Waters, and
      another run of fifty into Powell&rsquo;s Creek, dry or otherwise according
      to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takes a bit of fizzing to get into the Powell before the fourth
      sundown,&rdquo; the Fizzer says&mdash;for, forgetting that there can be no
      change of horses, and leaving no time for a &ldquo;spell&rdquo; after the
      &ldquo;seventy-five-mile dry &ldquo;&mdash;the time limit for that one
      hundred and fifty miles, in a country where four miles an hour is good
      travelling on good roads has been fixed at three and a half days. &ldquo;Four,
      they call it,&rdquo; says the Fizzer, &ldquo;forgetting I can&rsquo;t
      leave the water till midday. Takes a bit of fizzing all right&rdquo;; and
      yet at Powell&rsquo;s Creek no one has yet discovered whether the Fizzer
      comes at sundown, or the sun goes down when the Fizzer comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bit off,&rdquo; he calls that stage, with a school-boy shrug of
      his shoulders; but at Renner&rsquo;s Springs, twenty miles farther on, the
      shoulders set square, and the man comes to the surface. The dice-throwing
      begins there, and the stakes are high&mdash;a man&rsquo;s life against a
      man&rsquo;s judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people speak of the Fizzer&rsquo;s luck, and say he&rsquo;ll pull
      through, if any one can. It is luck, perhaps&mdash;but not in the sense
      they mean&mdash;to have the keen judgment to know to an ounce what a horse
      has left in him, judgment to know when to stop and when to go on&mdash;for
      that is left to the Fizzer&rsquo;s discretion; and with that judgment the
      dauntless courage to go on with, and win through, every task attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fizzer changes horses at Renner&rsquo;s Springs for the &ldquo;Downs&rsquo;
      trip&rdquo;; and as his keen eyes run over the mob, his voice raps out
      their verdict like an auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fit. So
      is he. Cut that one out. That colt&rsquo;s A1. The chestnut&rsquo;s done.
      So is the brown. I&rsquo;ll risk that mare. That black&rsquo;s too fat.&rdquo;
      No hesitation: horse after horse rejected or approved, until the team is
      complete; and then driving them before him he faces the Open Downs&mdash;the
      Open Downs, where the last mail-man perished; and only the men who know
      the Downs in the Dry know what he faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five trips out of the eight, one hundred and thirty miles of
      sun-baked, crab-holed, practically trackless plains, no sign of human
      habitation anywhere, cracks that would swallow a man&mdash;&ldquo;hardly
      enough wood to boil a quart pot,&rdquo; the Fizzer says, and a
      sun-temperature hovering about 160 degrees (there is no shade-temperature
      on the Downs); shadeless, trackless, sun-baked, crab-holed plains, and the
      Fizzer&rsquo;s team a moving speck in the centre of an immensity that,
      never diminishing and never changing, moves onward with the team; an
      immensity of quivering heat and glare, with that one tiny living speck in
      its centre, and in all that hundred and thirty miles one drink for the
      horses at the end of the first eighty. That is the Open Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fizz!&rdquo; shouts the Fizzer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the real
      fizzing gets done, and nobody that hasn&rsquo;t tried it knows what it&rsquo;s
      like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He travels its first twenty miles late in the afternoon, then, unpacking
      his team, &ldquo;lets &rsquo;em go for a roll and a pick, while he boils a
      quart pot&rdquo; (the Fizzer carries a canteen for himself); &ldquo;spells&rdquo;
      a bare two hours, packs up again and travels all night, keeping to the
      vague track with a bushman&rsquo;s instinct, &ldquo;doing&rdquo; another
      twenty miles before daylight; unpacks for another spell, pities the poor
      brutes &ldquo;nosing round too parched to feed,&rdquo; may &ldquo;doze a
      bit with one ear cocked,&rdquo; and then packing up again, &ldquo;punches
      &rsquo;em along all day,&rdquo; with or without a spell. Time is precious
      now. There is a limit to the number of hours a horse can go without water,
      and the thirst of the team fixes the time limit on the Downs. &ldquo;Punches
      &rsquo;em along all day, and into water close up sundown,&rdquo; at the
      deserted Eva Downs station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em a drink at the well there,&rdquo; the Fizzer says as
      unconcernedly as though he turned on a tap. But the well is old and out of
      repair, ninety feet deep, with a rickety old wooden windlass; fencing wire
      for a rope; a bucket that the Fizzer has &ldquo;seen fit to plug with rag
      on account of it leaking a bit,&rdquo; and a trough, stuffed with mud at
      one end by the resourceful Fizzer. Truly the Government is careful for the
      safety of its servants. Added to all this, there are eight or ten horses
      so eager for a drink that the poor brutes have to be tied up, and watered
      one at a time; and so parched with thirst that it takes three hours&rsquo;
      drawing before they are satisfied&mdash;three hours&rsquo; steady drawing,
      on top of twenty-three hours out of twenty-seven spent in the saddle, and
      half that time &ldquo;punching&rdquo; jaded beasts along; and yet they
      speak of the &ldquo;Fizzer&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real fine old water too,&rdquo; the Fizzer shouts in delight, as he
      tells his tale. &ldquo;Kept in the cellar for our special use. Don&rsquo;t
      indulge in it much myself. Might spoil my palate for newer stuff, so I
      carry enough for the whole trip from Renner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Downs have left deep lines on the Fizzer&rsquo;s face, they have
      left none in his heart. Yet at that well the dice-throwing goes on just
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the Fizzer feels &ldquo;a bit knocked out with the sun,&rdquo; and
      the water for his perishing horses ninety feet below the surface; or
      &ldquo;things go wrong&rdquo; with the old windlass, and everything
      depends on the Fizzer&rsquo;s ingenuity. The odds are very uneven when
      this happens&mdash;a man&rsquo;s ingenuity against a man&rsquo;s life, and
      death playing with loaded dice. And every letter the Fizzer carries past
      that well costs the public just twopence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drink at the well, an all-night&rsquo;s spell, another drink, and then
      away at midday, to face the tightest pinch of all&mdash;the pinch where
      death won with the other mail-man. Fifty miles of rough, hard, blistering,
      scorching &ldquo;going,&rdquo; with worn and jaded horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old programme all over again. Twenty miles more, another spell for the
      horses (the Fizzer never seems to need a spell for himself), and then the
      last lap of thirty, the run into Anthony&rsquo;s Lagoon, &ldquo;punching
      the poor beggars along somehow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em going all
      night,&rdquo; the Fizzer says; &ldquo;and if you should happen to be at
      Anthony&rsquo;s on the day I&rsquo;m due there you can set your watch for
      eleven in the morning when you see me coming along.&rdquo; I have heard
      somewhere of the Pride of Harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixteen days is the time-limit for those five-hundred miles, and yet the
      Fizzer is expected because the Fizzer is due; and to a man who loves his
      harness no praise could be sweeter than that. Perhaps one of the brightest
      thoughts for the Fizzer as he &ldquo;punches&rdquo; along those desolate
      Downs is the knowledge that a little before eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning Anthony&rsquo;s will come out, and, standing with shaded eyes,
      will look through the quivering heat, away into the Downs for that tiny
      moving speck. When the Fizzer is late there, death will have won at the
      dice-throwing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he got a salary. No one ever troubled to ask. He was expected,
      and he came, and in our selfishness we did not concern ourselves beyond
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is men like the Fizzer who, &ldquo;keeping the roads open,&rdquo; lay
      the foundation-stones of great cities; and yet when cities creep into the
      Never-Never along the Fizzer&rsquo;s mail route, in all probability they
      will be called after Members of Parliament and the Prime Ministers of that
      day, grandsons, perhaps, of the men who forgot to keep the old well in
      repair, while our Fizzer and the mail-man who perished will be forgotten;
      for townsfolk are apt to forget the beginnings of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days&rsquo; spell at Anthony&rsquo;s, to wait for the Queensland
      mail-man from the &ldquo;other-side&rdquo; (another Fizzer no doubt, for
      the bush mail-service soon culls out the unfitted), an exchange of
      mail-bags, and then the Downs must be faced again with the same team of
      horses. Even the Fizzer owns that &ldquo;tackling the Downs for the return
      trip&rsquo;s a bit sickening; haven&rsquo;t had time to forget what it
      feels like, you know,&rdquo; he explains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside to Anthony&rsquo;s, three days&rsquo; spell, over the Downs again,
      stopping for another drink at that well, along the stage &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      a bit off,&rdquo; and back to the &ldquo;kid&rsquo;s game,&rdquo; dropping
      mail-bags in twos and threes as he goes in, and collecting others as he
      comes out, to say nothing of the weary packing and unpacking of his team.
      That is what the Fizzer had to do by half-past eleven four weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will go hopelessly on the spree at the end of the trip,&rdquo;
      say uncharitable folk; but they do not know our Fizzer. &ldquo;Once upon a
      time I was a bad little boy,&rdquo; our Fizzer says now, &ldquo;but since
      I learnt sense a billy of tea&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And our Fizzer is not the only man out-bush who has &ldquo;learnt sense.&rdquo;
      Man after man I have met who found tea &ldquo;good enough,&rdquo; and many
      more who &ldquo;know how to behave themselves.&rdquo; Sadly enough, there
      are others in plenty who find their temptations too strong for them&mdash;temptations
      that the world hardly guesses at.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I love the bush-folk for the good that is in them, hidden, so often,
      carefully away deep down in their brave, strong hearts&mdash;hearts and
      men that ring true, whether they have &ldquo;learnt sense,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;know how to behave,&rdquo; or are only of the others. But every man&rsquo;s
      life runs parallel with other lives, and while the Fizzer was &ldquo;punching
      along&rdquo; his dry stages events were moving rapidly with us; while
      perhaps, away in the hearts of towns, men and women were &ldquo;winning
      through the dry stages&rdquo; of their lives there.

    <p>
      Soon after the Fizzer left us the horse-teams came in, and went on,
      top-heavy with stores for &ldquo;inside&rdquo;; but the &ldquo;Macs&rdquo;
      were now thinking of the dry stages ahead, and were travelling at the
      exasperating rate of about four miles a day, as they &ldquo;nursed the
      bullocks&rdquo; through the good grass country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had lost interest in waggons, and was anxious to get among the cattle
      again; but with the trunks so near, the house growing rapidly, the days of
      sewing waiting, I refused point-blank to leave the homestead just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan tried to taunt me into action, and reviewed the &ldquo;kennel&rdquo;
      with critical eyes. &ldquo;Never saw a dog makin&rsquo;, its own chain
      before,&rdquo; he said to the M&#259;luka as I sat among billows of calico
      and mosquito netting. But the homemaking instinct is strong in a woman,
      and the musterers went out west without the missus. The Dandy being back
      at the Bitter Springs superintending the carting of new posts for the
      stockyard there, the missus was left in the care of Johnny and Cheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; said Johnny, and Cheon,
      believing him, expressed great admiration for Johnny, and superintended
      the scrubbing of the walls, while I sat and sewed, yard after yard of
      oversewing, as never woman sewed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls were erected on what is known as the drop-slab-panel system&mdash;upright
      panels formed of three-foot slabs cut from the outside slice of tree
      trunks, and dropped horizontally, one above the other, between grooved
      posts&mdash;a simple arrangement, quickly run up and artistic in
      appearance&mdash;outside, a horizontally fluted surface, formed by the
      natural curves of the timber, and inside, flat, smooth walls. As in every
      third panel there was a door or a window, and as the horizontal slabs
      stopped within two feet of the ceiling, the building was exceedingly airy,
      and open on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon, convinced that the system was all Johnny&rsquo;s was delighted with
      his ingenuity. But as he insisted on the walls being scrubbed as soon as
      they were up, and before the doors and windows were in, Johnny had one or
      two good duckings, and narrowly escaped many more; for lubras&rsquo;
      methods of scrubbing are as full of surprises as all their methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      First soap is rubbed on the dry boards, then vigorously scrubbed into a
      lather with wet brushes, and after that the lather is sluiced off with
      artificial waterspouts whizzed up the walls from full buckets. It was
      while the sluicing was in progress that Johnny had to be careful; for many
      buckets missed their mark, and the waterspouts shot out through the
      doorways and window frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearing a mackintosh, I did what I could to prevent surprises, but without
      much success. Johnny fortunately took it all as a matter of course.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the good cause,&rdquo; he chuckled, shaking
      himself like a water-spaniel after a particularly bad misadventure; and
      described the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; with great zest to the M&#259;luka
      when he returned. The sight of the clean walls filled the M&#259;luka also
      with zeal for the cause, and in the week that followed walls sprouted with
      corner shelves and brackets&mdash;three wooden kerosene cases became a
      handy series of pigeonholes for magazines and papers. One panel in the
      dining-room was completely filled with bookshelves, one above the other
      for our coming books. Great sheets of bark, stripped by the blacks from
      the Ti Tree forest, were packed a foot deep above the rafters to break the
      heat reflected from the iron roof, while beneath it the calico ceiling was
      tacked up. And all the time Johnny hammered and whistled and planed,
      finishing the bathroom and &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; with the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Quiet Stockman coming in, was pressed into the service, and grew quite
      enthusiastic, suggesting substitutes for necessities, until <i>I</i>
      suggested cutting off the tail of every horse on the run, to get enough
      horsehair for a mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe the boss&rsquo;ud do it himself if she asked him,&rdquo; he
      said in the Quarters; and in his consternation suggested bangtailing the
      cattle during the musters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing,&rdquo; Dan decided; and we soon saw, with his
      assistance, a vision of our future mattress walkin&rsquo; about the run on
      the ends of cows&rsquo; tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a dead-heat,&rdquo; Johnny said,
      still hammering, when the Dandy brought in word that the Macs were within
      twelve miles of the homestead. And when I announced next day that the
      dining-net was finished and ready for hanging, he also became wildly
      enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you from the beginning we shouldn&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; he
      said, flourishing a hammer and brimming over with suggestions for the
      hanging of the net. &ldquo;Rope&rsquo;ll never hold it,&rdquo; he
      declared; &ldquo;fencing wire&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; so fencing wire
      was used, and after a hard morning&rsquo;s work pulling and straining the
      wire and securing it to uprights, the net was in its place, the calico
      roof smooth and flat against the ceiling, and its curtains hanging to the
      floor, with strong, straight saplings run through the folded hem to weigh
      it down. Cheon was brimming over with admiration for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, boss! Missus plenty savey,&rdquo; he said. (Cheon
      invariably discussed the missus in her presence.) &ldquo;Chinaman woman no
      more savey likee that,&rdquo; and bustling away, dinner was soon served
      inside the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myriads of flies, balked in their desire, settled down on the outside, and
      while we enjoyed our dinner in peace and comfort, Cheon hovered about,
      like a huge bloated buzz fly himself, chuckling around the outside among
      the swarms of balked flies, or coming inside to see if &ldquo;any fly sit
      down inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, boss! Hear him sing-out sing-out. Missus plenty savey,&rdquo;
      he reiterated, and then calling a Chinese friend from the kitchen, stood
      over him, until he also declared that &ldquo;missus&nbsp;<i>blenty&nbsp;</i>savey,&rdquo;
      with good emphasis on the&nbsp;<i>blenty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The net was up by midday, and at ten o&rsquo;clock at night the slow, dull
      clang of a bullock-bell crept out of the forest. Cheon was the first to
      hear it. &ldquo;Bullocky come on,&rdquo; he called, waddling to the house
      and waking us from our first sleep; and as the deep-throated bell boomed
      out again the M&#259;luka said drowsily: &ldquo;The homestead&rsquo;s only
      won by a head. Mac&rsquo;s at the Warlochs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At &ldquo;fowl-sing-out&rdquo; we were up, and found Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie
      behind the black boys&rsquo; humpy shyly peeping round a corner. With
      childlike impetuosity she had scampered along the four miles from the
      Warlochs, only to be overcome with unaccountable shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allo, missus!&rdquo; was all she could find to say, and the
      remainder of the interview she filled in with wriggling and giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after breakfast Mac splashed through the creek at a
      hand-gallop and, dashing up to the house, flung himself from his horse,
      the same impetuous, warmhearted &ldquo;Brither Scot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience rewarded at last,&rdquo; he called in welcome; and when
      invited to &ldquo;come ben the hoose to the dining-room,&rdquo; was, as
      usual, full of congratulations. &ldquo;My! We are some!&rdquo; he said,
      examining every detail. But as he also said that &ldquo;the Dandy could
      get the trunks right off if we liked to send him across with the dray,&rdquo;
      we naturally &ldquo;liked,&rdquo; and Johnny and the Dandy harnessing up,
      went with him, and before long the verandah and rooms were piled with
      trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately Dan was &ldquo;bush&rdquo; again among the cattle, or his
      heart would have broken at this new array of links for the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the trunks were all in, Mac, the Dandy, and Johnny retired to the
      Quarters after a few more congratulations, Johnny continuing his
      flourishes all the way across. Cheon however, with his charming disregard
      for conventionality being interested, settled himself on one of the trunks
      to watch the opening up of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have ordered him away would have clouded his beaming happiness; so he
      remained, and told us exactly what he thought of our possessions, adding
      much to the pleasure of the opening of the trunks. If any woman would
      experience real pleasure, let her pack all her belongings into trunks&mdash;all
      but a couple of changes of everything&mdash;and go away out-bush, leaving
      them to follow &ldquo;after the Wet&rdquo; per bullock waggon, and when
      the reunion takes place the pleasure will be forthcoming. If she can find
      a Cheon to be present at the reunion, so much the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our belongings Cheon thoroughly approved of; others were passed
      over as unworthy of notice; and others were held up to chuckling ridicule.
      A silver teapot was pounced upon with a cry of delight (tinware being
      considered far beneath the dignity of a missus, and seeing Sam had broken
      the china pot soon after its arrival, tinware had graced our board for
      some time), pictures were looked at askance, particularly an engraving of
      Psyche at the Pool; while the case for a set of carvers received boundless
      admiration, although the carvers in no way interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The photographs of friends and relatives were looked carefully over, the
      womenfolk being judged by what they might bring in a Chinese matrimonial
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! That one good-looking. Him close up sixty pound longa
      China,&rdquo; was rather disconcerting praise of a very particular lady
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brass lamp was looked upon as a monument of solid wealth, &ldquo;Him
      gold,&rdquo; he decided, insisting it was in the face of all denials.
      &ldquo;Him gold. Me savey gold all right. Me live longa California long
      time,&rdquo; he said, bringing forward a most convincing argument; and,
      dismissing the subject with one of his Podsnapian waves, he decided that a
      silver-coloured composition flower-bowl in the form of a swan was solid
      silver; &ldquo;Him sing out all a same silver,&rdquo; he said, making it
      ring with a flick of his finger and thumb, when I differed from him, and
      knowing Cheon by now, we left it at that for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wandering through several trunks and gloating over blouses, and
      skirts, and house-linen, and old friends the books were opened up, and
      before the M&#259;luka became lost to the world Cheon favoured them with a
      passing glance. &ldquo;Big mob book,&rdquo; he said indifferently, and
      turned his attention to the last trunk of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the top was a silver filigree candlestick moulded into the form of a
      Convolvulus flower and leaf&mdash;a dainty little thing, but it appeared
      ridiculous to Cheon&rsquo;s commonsense mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him silly fellow,&rdquo; he scoffed, and appealed to the M&#259;luka
      for his opinion: &ldquo;him silly fellow? Eh boss?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka was half-buried in books. &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; he murmured
      absently, and that clinched the matter for all time. &ldquo;Boss bin talk
      silly fellow&rdquo; Cheon said, with an approving nod toward the M&#259;luka,
      and advised packing the candlestick away again. &ldquo;Plenty room sit
      down longa box,&rdquo; he said, truthfully enough, putting it into an
      enormous empty trunk and closing the lid, leaving the candlestick a piece
      of lonely splendour hidden under a bushel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the full glory of our possessions was now to burst upon Cheon. The
      trunk we were at was half filled with all sorts of cunning devices for
      kitchen use, intended for the mistress&rsquo;s pantry of that commodious
      station home of past ignorant imagination. A mistress&rsquo;s pantry
      forsooth, in a land where houses are superfluous and luxuries barred, and
      at a homestead where the mistress had long ceased to be anything but the
      little missus&mdash;something to rule or educate or take care of,
      according to the nature of her subordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash I knew all I had once been, and quailing before the awful proof
      before me, presented Cheon with the whole collection of tin and enamel
      ware, and packed him off to the kitchen before the M&#259;luka had time to
      lose interest in the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was exactly what Cheon most needed, and he accepted everything
      with gleeful chuckles&mdash;everything excepting a kerosene Primus burner
      for boiling a kettle. That he refused to touch. &ldquo;Him go bang,&rdquo;
      he explained, as usual explicit and picturesque in his English.
    </p>
    <p>
      After gathering his treasures together he waddled away to the kitchen, and
      at afternoon tea we had sponge cakes, light and airy beyond all dreams of
      airy lightness, no one having yet combined the efforts of Cheon, a flour
      dredge, and an egg-beater, in his dreams. And Cheon&rsquo;s heart being as
      light as his cookery, in his glee he made a little joke at the expense of
      the Quarters, summoning all there to afternoon tea with a chuckling call
      of &ldquo;Cognac!&rdquo; chuckles that increased tenfold at the mock haste
      of the Quarters. A little joke, by the way, that never lost in freshness
      as the months went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals during the days that followed Cheon surveyed his treasures,
      and during these intervals the whirr of the flour dredge or egg-beater was
      heard from the kitchens, and invariably the whirr was followed by a low,
      distinct chuckle of appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon we worked, and by the evening the dining-room was
      transformed: blue cloths and lace runners on the deal side-table and
      improvised pigeon-holes; nicknacks here and there on tables and shelves
      and brackets; pictures on the walls; &ldquo;kent&rdquo; faces in
      photograph frames among the nicknacks; a folding carpet-seated armchair in
      a position of honour; cretonne curtains in the doorway between the rooms,
      and inside the shimmering white net a study in colour effect&mdash;blue
      and white matting on the floor, a crimson cloth on the table, and on the
      cloth Cheon&rsquo;s &ldquo;silver&rdquo; swan sailing in a sea of purple,
      blue, and heliotrope water-lilies. But best of all were the books&mdash;row
      upon row of old familiar friends; nearly two hundred of them filling the
      shelved panel as they looked down upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac was dazzled with the books. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t seen so many together
      since he was a nipper&rdquo;; and after we had introduced him to our
      favourites, we played with our new toys like a parcel of children, until
      supper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over we lit the lamp, and shutting doors and windows, shut
      the Sanguine Scot in with us, and made believe we were living once more
      within sound of the rumble of a great city. Childish behaviour, no doubt,
      but to be expected from folk who can find entertainment in the going to
      bed of fowls; but when the heart is happy it forgets to grow old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lighted lamp and closed doors, and the outside world is what you
      will it to be,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka theorised, and to disprove it Mac
      drew attention to the distant booming of the bells that swung from the
      neck of his grazing bullocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The city clocks,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;We hear them distinctly at
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the night was full of sounds all around the homestead, and Mac,
      determined to mock, joined in with the &ldquo;Song of the Frogs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quart pot! Qua-rt-pot!&rdquo; he croaked, as they sang outside in
      rumbling monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roll of the tramcars,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka interpreted
      gravely, as the long flowing gutturals blended into each other; and Mac&rsquo;s
      mood suddenly changing he entered into our sport, and soon put us to shame
      in make-believing; spoke of &ldquo;pining for a breath of fresh air&rdquo;;
      &ldquo;hoped&rdquo; to get away from the grime and dust of the city as
      soon as the session was over; wondered how he would shape &ldquo;at
      camping out,&rdquo; with an irrepressible chuckle. &ldquo;Often thought I&rsquo;d
      like to try it,&rdquo; he said, and invited us to help him make up a
      camping party. &ldquo;Be a change for us city chaps,&rdquo; he suggested;
      and then exploding at what he called his &ldquo;tomfoolery,&rdquo; set the
      dining-net all a-quivering and shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone clean dilly, I believe,&rdquo; he declared, after thinking
      that he had &ldquo;better be making a move for the last train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, mounting his waiting horse, he splashed through the creek again, and
      disappeared into the moonlit grove of pandanus palms beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggons spelled for two days at the Warlochs, and we saw much of the
      &ldquo;Macs.&rdquo; Then they decided to &ldquo;push on&rdquo;; for not
      only were others farther &ldquo;in&rdquo; waiting for the waggons, but
      daily the dry stages were getting longer and drier; and the shorter his
      dry stages are, the better a bullock-puncher likes them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With well-nursed bullocks, and a full complement of them&mdash;the &ldquo;Macs&rdquo;
      had twenty-two per waggon for their dry stages&mdash;a &ldquo;thirty-five-mile
      dry&rdquo; can be &ldquo;rushed,&rdquo; the waggoners getting under way by
      three o&rsquo;clock one afternoon, travelling all night with a spell or
      two for the bullocks by the way, and &ldquo;punching&rdquo; them into
      water within twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="page168" id="page168"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:75%;">

      <a href="images/page168.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting over a fifty-mile dry&rdquo; is, however, a more
      complicated business, and suggests a treadmill. The waggons are &ldquo;pulled
      out&rdquo; ten miles in the late afternoon, the bullocks unyoked and
      brought back to the water, spelled most of the next day, given a last
      drink and travelled back to the waiting waggons by sundown; yoked up and
      travelled on all that night and part of the next day; once more unyoked at
      the end of the forty miles of the stage; taken <i>forward</i> to the next
      water, and spelled and nursed up again at this water for a day or two;
      travelled back again to the waggons, and again yoked up, and finally
      brought forward in the night with the loads to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty miles dry with loaded waggons being the limit for mortal bullocks,
      the Government breaks the &ldquo;seventy-five&rdquo; with a &ldquo;drink&rdquo;
      sent out in tanks on one of the telegraph station waggons. The stage thus
      broken into &ldquo;a thirty-five-mile dry,&rdquo; with another of forty on
      top of that, becomes complicated to giddiness in its backings, and
      fillings, and goings, and comings, and returnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As each waggon carries only five tons, all things considered, from thirty
      to forty pounds a ton is not a high price to pay for the cartage of stores
      to &ldquo;inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But although the &ldquo;getting in&rdquo;, with the stores means much to
      the &ldquo;bush-folk,&rdquo; getting out again is the ultimate goal of the
      waggoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is time enough for the trip, but only good time, before the roads
      will be closed by the dry stages growing to impossible lengths for the
      bullocks to recross; and if the waggoners lose sight of their goal, and
      loiter by the way, they will find themselves &ldquo;shut in&rdquo; inside,
      with no prospect of getting out until the next Wet opens the road for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish Mac held records for getting over stages; but even he had been
      &ldquo;shut in&rdquo; once, and had sat kicking his heels all through a
      long Dry, wondering if the showers would come in time to let him out for
      the next year&rsquo;s loading, or if the Wet would break suddenly, and
      further shut him in with floods and bogs. The horse teams had been &ldquo;shut
      in&rdquo; the same year, but as the Macs explained, the teamsters had
      broached their cargo that year, and had a &ldquo;glorious spree&rdquo;
      with the cases of grog&mdash;a &ldquo;glorious spree&rdquo; that detained
      them so long on the road that by the time they were in there was no chance
      of getting out, and they had more than enough time to brace themselves for
      the interview that eventually came with their employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might a bullock-puncher have the privilege of shaking hands with a
      lady?&rdquo; the Irish Mac asked, extending an honest, horny hand; and the
      privilege, if it were one, was granted. Finally all was ready, and the
      waggons, one behind the other, each with its long swaying line of bullocks
      before it, slid away from the Warloch Ponds and crept into the forest,
      looking like three huge snails with shells on their backs, Bertie&rsquo;s
      Nellie watching, wreathed in smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie had brought to the homestead her bosom friend and crony, Biddy, and
      the staff had increased to five. It would have numbered six, only Maudie,
      discovering that the house was infested with debbil-debbils, had resigned
      and &ldquo;gone bush.&rdquo; The debbil-debbils were supposed to haunt the
      M&#259;luka&rsquo;s telescope, for Maudie, on putting her eye to the sight
      opening, to find out what interested the M&#259;luka so often, had found
      the trees on the distant plain leaping towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Debbil-debbil, sit down,&rdquo; she screamed, as, flinging the
      telescope from her in a frenzy of fear, she found the distance still and
      composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more touch him, missus!&rdquo; she shrieked, as I stooped to
      pick up the telescope. &ldquo; &rsquo;Spose you touch him, all about there
      come on quick fellow. Me bin see him! My word him race!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After many assurances, I was allowed to pick it up, Maudie crouching in a
      shuddering heap the while behind the office, to guard against surprises.
      Next morning she applied for leave of absence and &ldquo;went bush.&rdquo;
      Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie, however, was not so easily scared, and after careful
      investigation treated herself to a pleasant half hour with the telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tree all day walk about,&rdquo; she said, explaining the mystery to
      the staff; and the looking-glass speedily lost in favour. The telescope
      proved full of delights. But although it was a great sight to see a
      piccaninny &ldquo;come on big-fellow,&rdquo; nothing could compare with
      the joy of looking through the reversed end of the glass, into a world
      where great men became &ldquo;little fellow,&rdquo; unless it were the
      marvel of watching dim, distant specks as they took on the forms of birds,
      beasts, or men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggons gone, and with them Nellie&rsquo;s shyness, she quietly ousted
      Rosy from her position at the head of the staff. &ldquo;Me sit down first
      time,&rdquo; she said; and happy, smiling Rosy, retiring, obeyed orders as
      willingly as she had given them. With Nellie and Rosy at the head of
      affairs, house-cleaning passed unnoticed, and although, after the arrival
      of unlimited changes of everything, washing-day threatened to become a
      serious business, they coped with that difficulty by continuing to live in
      a cycle of washing days&mdash;every alternate day only, though, so as to
      leave time for gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardening staff, which consisted of a king, an heir-apparent, and a
      royal councillor, had been engaged to wheel barrow-loads of rich loamy
      soil from the billabong to the garden beds; but as its members preferred
      gossiping in the shade to work of any kind, the gardening took time and
      supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Gadgerrie?&rdquo; was the invariable question
      after each load, as the staff prepared to sit down for a gossip; and
      &ldquo;Gadgerrie&rdquo; had to start every one afresh, after deciding
      whose turn it was to ride back to the billabong in the barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six loads in a morning was a fair record, for &ldquo;Gadgerrie&rdquo; was
      not often disinclined for a gossip on court matters, but although nothing
      was done while we were out-bush, the garden was gradually growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the beds against the verandah were gaily flourishing, others
      &ldquo;coming on,&rdquo; and outside the broad pathway a narrow bed had
      been made all round the garden for an hibiscus hedge; while outside this
      bed again, one at each corner of the garden, stood four posts&mdash;the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      promise of a dog-proof, goat-proof, fowl-proof fence. So far Tiddle&rsquo;ums
      had acted as fence, when we were in, at the homestead, scattering fowls,
      goats, and dairy cows in all directions if they dared come over a line she
      had drawn in her mind&rsquo;s eye. When Tiddle&rsquo;ums was out-bush with
      us, Bett-Bett acted as fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny, generally repairing the homestead now, admired the garden and
      declared everything would be &ldquo;A1 in no time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t know the old place,&rdquo; he said, a day or two
      later, surveying his own work with pride. Then he left us, and for the
      first time I was sorry the house was finished. Johnny was one of the men
      who had not &ldquo;learnt sense&rdquo; but the world would be a better
      place if there were more Johnnies in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we were preparing to go out-bush for reports, Dan came in with a
      mob of cattle for branding and the news that a yard on the northern
      boundary was gone from the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean gone since last Dry,&rdquo; he reported; &ldquo;burnt or
      washed away, or both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than let his cattle go, he had travelled in nearly thirty miles
      with the mob in hand, but &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;good
      enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;The time I&rsquo;ve had with them staggering bobs,&rdquo;
      he said, when we pitied the poor, weary, footsore little calves: &ldquo;could
      &rsquo;av brought in a mob of snails quicker. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t good
      enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka also considered it not &ldquo;good enough,&rdquo; and
      decided to run up a rough branding wing at once on to the holding yard at
      the Springs; and while Dan saw to the branding of the mob the M&#259;luka
      looked out his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get much hair for the mattress?&rdquo; I asked, all in good
      faith, when Dan came down from the yards to the house to discuss the
      plans, and Dan stood still, honestly vexed with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blest!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t
      forget all about it,&rdquo; and then tried to console me by saying I
      wouldn&rsquo;t need a mattress till the mustering was over. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      carry it round with you, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it won&rsquo;t
      be needed anywhere else.&rdquo; Then he surveyed the house with his
      philosophical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t know the old place,&rdquo; Johnny had said, and Dan
      &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo; it was &ldquo;all right as houses go.&rdquo; Adding
      with a chuckle, &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s wrestled with luck for more&rsquo;n
      four months to get it, but the question is, what&rsquo;s she going to use
      it for now she&rsquo;s got it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter14" id="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      For over four months we had wrestled with luck for a house, only to find
      we had very little use for it for the time being, that is, until next Wet.
      It couldn&rsquo;t be carried out-bush from camp to camp, and finding us at
      a loss for an answer, Dan suggested one himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he said, as he eyed the furnishings with
      interest, &ldquo;it &rsquo;ud come in handy to pack the chain away in
      while the dog was out enjoying itself&rdquo;; and we left it at that. It
      <i>came </i>in handy to pack the chain away in while the dog was enjoying
      itself, for within twenty-four hours we were camped at the Bitter Springs,
      and two weeks passed before the homestead saw us again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our experience of &ldquo;getting hold of Johnny,&rdquo; Dan called
      it foolishness to wait for an expert, and the Dandy being away for the
      remainder of the stores, and the Quiet Stockman having his hands full to
      overflowing, the M&#259;luka and Dan with that adaptability peculiar to
      bushmen, set to work themselves at the yard, with fifteen or twenty boys
      as apprentices.
    </p>
    <p>
      As most of the boys had their lubras with them, it was an immense camp,
      but exceedingly pretty. One small tent &ldquo;fly&rdquo; for a
      dressing-room for the missus, and the remainder of the accommodation&mdash;open-air
      and shady bough gundies; tiny, fresh, cool, green shade-houses here,
      there, and everywhere for the blacks; one set apart from the camp for a
      larder, and an immense one&mdash;all green waving boughs&mdash;for the
      missus to rest in during the heat of the day. &ldquo;The Cottage,&rdquo;
      Dan called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Sool&rsquo;em and Brown were with us, Little Tiddle&rsquo;ums
      being in at the homestead on the sick list with a broken leg; and in
      addition to Sool&rsquo;em and Brown an innumerable band of nigger dogs,
      Billy Muck being the adoring possessor of fourteen, including pups, which
      fanned out behind him as he moved hither and thither like the tail of a
      comet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our camp being a stationary one, was, by comparison with our ordinary
      camps, a <i>campe-de-luxe</i>; for, apart from the tent-fly, in it were
      books, pillows, and a canvas lounge, as well as some of the flesh-pots of
      Egypt, in the shape of eggs, cakes, and vegetables sent out every few days
      by Cheon, to say nothing of scrub turkeys, fish, and such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had no objection to the eggs, cakes, or vegetables, but the pillows
      and canvas lounge tried him sorely. &ldquo;Thought the chain was to be
      left behind in the kennel,&rdquo; he said, and decided that the &ldquo;next
      worst thing to being chained up was&rdquo; for a dog to have to drag a
      chain round when it was out for a run. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;never been chained up all me life, just because I never had enough
      permanent property to make a chain&mdash;never more than I could carry in
      one hand: a bluey, a change of duds, a mosquito net, and a box of Cockle&rsquo;s
      pills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We suggested that Cockle&rsquo;s pills were hardly permanent property, but
      Dan showed that they were, with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More permanent than you&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When
      I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em in me swag, I never need &rsquo;em, and when I&rsquo;ve
      left &rsquo;em somewhere else I can&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em: so you see the
      same box does for always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yard-building lacking in interest, lubras and piccaninnies provided
      entertainment, until Dan failing to see that &ldquo;niggers could teach
      her anything,&rdquo; decided on a course of camp cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roast scrub turkey was the first lesson cooked in the most correct style:
      a forked stick, with the fork uppermost, was driven into the ground near
      the glowing heap of wood ashes; then a long sapling was leant through the
      fork, with one end well over the coals; a doubled string, with the turkey
      hanging from it, looped over this end; the turkey turned round and round
      until the string was twisted to its utmost, and finally string and turkey
      were left to themselves, to wind and unwind slowly, an occasional
      winding-up being all that was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turkey was served at supper, and with it an enormous boiled cabbage&mdash;one
      of Cheon&rsquo;s successes. Dan was in clover, boiled cabbage being
      considered nectar fit for the gods, and after supper he put the remnants
      of the feast away for his breakfast. &ldquo;Cold cabbage goes all right,&rdquo;
      he said, as he stowed it carefully away&mdash;&ldquo;particularly for
      breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the daily damper was to be made, and I took the dish without a
      misgiving. I felt at home there, for bushmen have long since discarded the
      old-fashioned damper, and use soda and cream-of-tartar in the mixture. But
      ours was an immense camp, and I had reckoned without any thought. An
      immense camp requires an immense damper; and, the dish containing pounds
      and pounds of flour, when the mixture was ready for kneading the kneading
      was beyond a woman&rsquo;s hands&mdash;a fact that provided much amusement
      to the bushmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit him again, little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka cried
      encouragingly, as I punched and pummelled at the unwieldy mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him, missus,&rdquo; Dan chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the style! Now you&rsquo;ve got him down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling in front of the dish, I pounded obediently at the mixture; and as
      they alternately cheered and advised and I wrestled with circumstances,
      digging my fists vigorously into the spongy, doughy depths of the damper,
      a traveller rode right into the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, mates,&rdquo; he said, dismounting. &ldquo;Saw your
      fires, and thought I&rsquo;d camp near for company.&rdquo; Then
      discovering that one of the &ldquo;mates&rdquo; was a woman, backed a few
      steps, dazed and open-mouthed&mdash;a woman, dough to the elbows, pounding
      blithely at a huge damper, being an unusual sight in a night camp in the
      heart of one of the cattle runs in the Never-Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re conducting a cooking class,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      explained, amused at the man&rsquo;s consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller grinned a sickly grin, and &ldquo;begging pardon, ma&rsquo;am,
      for intruding,&rdquo; said something about seeing to his camp, and backed
      to a more comfortable distance; and the damper-making proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a billy just thinking of boiling here you can have,
      mate, seeing it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; Dan called, when he heard the man
      rattling tinware, as he prepared to go for water; and once more &ldquo;begging
      pardon, ma&rsquo;am, for intruding,&rdquo; the traveller came into our
      camp circle, and busied himself with the making of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea made to his satisfaction, he asked diffidently if there was a
      &ldquo;bit of meat to spare,&rdquo; as his was a &ldquo;bit off&rdquo;;
      and Dan went to the larder with a hospitable &ldquo;stacks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would boiled cabbage and roast turkey go?&rdquo; Dan called,
      finding himself confronted with the great slabs of cabbage; and the
      traveller, thinking it was supposed to be a joke, favoured us with another
      nervous grin and a terse &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Then Dan reappeared, laden,
      and the man&rsquo;s eyes glistened as he forgot his first surprise in his
      second. &ldquo;Real cabbage!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Gosh! ain&rsquo;t
      tasted cabbage for five years&rdquo;; and the M&#259;luka telling him to
      &ldquo;sit right down then and begin, just where you are&rdquo;&mdash;beside
      our camp fire&mdash;with a less nervous &ldquo;begging your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
      he dropped down on one knee, and began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy of the turkey,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka said
      presently, noticing that he had only taken a tiny piece, and the man
      looked sheepishly up. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t exactly that I&rsquo;m
      shy of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m scared to fill up any
      space that might hold cabbage. That is,&rdquo; he added, again apologetic,
      &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s not wanted, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t wanted; and as the man found room for it, the M&#259;luka
      and Dan offered further suggestions for the construction of the damper and
      its conveyance to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conveyance required judgment and watchful diplomacy, as the damper
      preferred to dip in a rolling valley between my extended arms, or hang
      over them like a tablecloth, rather than keep its desired form. But with
      patience, and the loan of one of Dan&rsquo;s huge palms, it finally fell
      with an unctuous, dusty &ldquo;whouf&rdquo; into the opened-out bed of
      ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was hidden away, buried in the heart of the fire, a woman&rsquo;s
      presence in a camp had proved less disturbing than might be imagined, and
      we learned that our traveller had &ldquo;come from Beyanst,&rdquo; with a
      backward nod towards the Queensland border, and was going west; and by the
      time the cabbage and tea were finished he had become quite talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen cabbage, ma&rsquo;am, for more&rsquo;n five years,&rdquo;
      he said, leaning back on to a fallen tree trunk, with a satisfied sigh
      (cabbage and tea being inflating), adding when I sympathised, &ldquo;nor a
      woman neither, for that matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither a cabbage nor a woman for five years! Think of it, townsfolk!
      Neither a cabbage nor a woman&mdash;with the cabbage placed first. I
      wonder which will be longest remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came on this, though, in me last camp, east there,&rdquo; he went
      on, producing a hairpin, with another nod eastwards. &ldquo;Wondered how
      it got there. Your&rsquo;n, I s&rsquo;pose&rdquo;; then, sheepish once
      more, he returned it to his pocket, saying he &ldquo;s&rsquo;posed he
      might as well keep it for luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It being a new experience to one of the plain sisterhood to feel a man was
      cherishing one of her hairpins, if only &ldquo;for luck,&rdquo; I warmed
      towards the &ldquo;man from Beyanst,&rdquo; and grew hopeful of rivalling
      even that cabbage in his memory. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to find
      hairpins, and a woman, in a camp in the back blocks,&rdquo; I said,
      feeling he was a character, and longing for him to open up. But he was
      even more of a character than I guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back blocks!&rdquo; he said in scorn. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no
      back blocks left. Can&rsquo;t travel a hundred miles nowadays without
      running into somebody! You don&rsquo;t know what back blocks is, begging
      your pardon, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan did; and the camp chat that night was worth travelling several
      hundred miles to hear: tales dug out of the beginning of things; tales of
      drought, and flood, and privation; cattle-duffing yarns, and long tales of
      the droving days; two years&rsquo; reminiscences of getting through with a
      mob&mdash;reminiscences that finally brought ourselves and the mob to
      Oodnadatta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place if you want to see drunks, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
      the traveller said, forgetting in his warmth his &ldquo;begging your
      pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; just when it would have been most opportune,
      seeing I had little hankering to see &ldquo;drunks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the desert does it, missus, after the overland trip,&rdquo;
      Dan explained. &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud give anybody a &lsquo;drouth.&rsquo;
      Got a bit merry meself there once and had to clear out to camp,&rdquo; he
      went on. &ldquo;Felt it getting a bit too warm for me to stand. You see,
      it was when the news came through that the old Queen was dead, and being
      something historical that had happened, the chaps felt it ought to be
      celebrated properly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Queen! And yet, perhaps, her grand, noble heart would have
      understood these, her subjects, and known them for the men they were&mdash;as
      loyal-hearted and true to her as the highest in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were lying two-deep about the place next morning,&rdquo; Dan
      added, continuing his tale; but the M&#259;luka, fearing the turn the
      conversation had taken, suggested turning in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dan having found a kindred spirit in the traveller, laid a favourite
      trap for one of his favourite jokes: shaking out a worn old bluey, he
      examined it carefully in the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanket&rsquo;s a bit thin, mate,&rdquo; said the man from Beyanst,
      unconsciously playing his part. &ldquo;Surely it can&rsquo;t keep you warm&rdquo;;
      and Dan&rsquo;s eyes danced in anticipation of his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well!&rdquo; he said, solemn-looking as an owl, as he tucked it
      under one arm, &ldquo;if it can&rsquo;t keep a chap warm after ten years&rsquo;
      experience it&rsquo;ll never do it,&rdquo; and turned in at once, with his
      usual lack of ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had boiled eggs for breakfast, and once more the traveller joined us.
      Cheon had sent the eggs out with the cabbage, and I had hidden them away,
      intending to spring a surprise on the men-folk at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many eggs shall I boil for you, Dan?&rdquo; I said airily,
      springing my surprise in this way on all the camp. But Dan, wheeling with
      an exclamation of pleasure, sprung a surprise of his own on the missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eggs!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good enough! How many? Oh, a dozen&rsquo;ll
      do, seeing we&rsquo;ve got steak&rdquo;; and I limply showed all I had&mdash;fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan scratched his head trying to solve the problem. &ldquo;Never reckon it&rsquo;s
      worth beginning under a dozen,&rdquo; he said; but finally suggested
      tossing for &rsquo;em after they were cooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the first time I&rsquo;ve tossed for eggs either,&rdquo; he
      said, busy grilling steak on a gridiron made from bent-up fencing wire.
      &ldquo;Out on the Victoria once they got scarce, and the cook used to boil
      all he had and serve the dice-box with &rsquo;em, the chap who threw the
      highest taking the lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever try to boil an emu&rsquo;s egg in a quart-pot?&rdquo; the man
      from Beyanst asked, &ldquo;lending a hand&rdquo; with another piece of
      fencing wire, using it as a fork to turn the steak on the impromptu
      gridiron. &ldquo;It goes in all right, but when it&rsquo;s cooked it won&rsquo;t
      come out, and you have to use the quart-pot for an egg-cup and make tea
      later on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A course dinner,&rdquo; Dan called that; and then nothing being
      forthcoming to toss with&mdash;dice or money not being among our permanent
      property&mdash;the eggs were distributed according to the &ldquo;holding
      capacity&rdquo; of the company: one for the missus, two for the M&#259;luka,
      and half a dozen each for the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller had no objection to beginning under a dozen, but Dan used
      his allowance as a &ldquo;relish&rdquo; with his steak. &ldquo;One egg!&rdquo;
      he chuckled as he shelled his relish and I enjoyed my breakfast. &ldquo;Often
      wonder how ever she keeps alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The damper proved &ldquo;just a bit boggy&rdquo; in the middle, so we ate
      the crisp outside slices and gave the boggy parts to the boys. They
      appeared to enjoy it, and seeing this, after breakfast the M&#259;luka
      asked them what they thought of the missus as a cook. &ldquo;Good damper,
      eh?&rdquo; he said, and Billy Muck rubbing his middle, full of damper and
      satisfaction, answered: &ldquo;My word! That one damper good fellow. Him
      sit down long time&rdquo;, and all the camp, rubbing middles, echoed his
      sentiments. The stodgy damper had made them feel full and uncomfortable;
      and to be full and uncomfortable after a meal spells happiness to a black
      fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope it won&rsquo;t sit too heavy on <i>my</i> chest,&rdquo;
      chuckled the man from Beyanst, then, remembering that barely twelve hours
      before he had ridden into the camp a stranger, began &ldquo;begging
      pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; most profusely again, and hoped we&rsquo;d
      excuse him &ldquo;making so free with a lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your being so friendly like, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
      explained. &ldquo;Most of the others I&rsquo;ve struck seemed too good for
      rough chaps like us. Of course,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      not saying that you&rsquo;re not as good as &rsquo;em. <i>You</i> ain&rsquo;t
      a Freezer on a pedestal, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka murmured and the man from
      Beyanst sympathised with him. &ldquo;Must be a bit off for their husbands,&rdquo;
      he said; and his apologies were forgotten in the absorbing topic of
      &ldquo;Freezers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Freezer on a pedestal,&rdquo; <i>he</i> had said. &ldquo;Goddess,&rdquo;
      the world prefers to call it; and tradition depicts the bushman
      worshipping afar off.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a &ldquo;Freezer&rdquo; is what <i>he</i> calls it to himself, and
      contrary to all tradition, goes on his way unmoved. And why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he? He may be, and generally is, sadly in need of a woman friend, &ldquo;some
      one to share his joys and sorrows with&rdquo;, but because he knows few
      women is no reason why he should stand afar off and adore the unknowable.
      &ldquo;Friendly like&rdquo; is what appeals to us all; and the bush-folk
      are only men, not monstrosities&mdash;rough, untutored men for the most
      part. The difficult part to understand is how any woman can choose to
      stand aloof and freeze, with warm-hearted men all around her willing to
      take her into their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the men exchanged opinions, &ldquo;Freezers&rdquo; appeared solitary
      creatures&mdash;isolated monuments of awe-inspiring goodness and purity,
      and I felt thankful that circumstances had made me only the Little Missus&mdash;a
      woman, down with the bushmen at the foot of all pedestals, needing all the
      love and fellowship she could get, and with no more goodness than she
      could do with&mdash;just enough to make her worthy of the friendship of
      &ldquo;rough chaps like us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; said the traveller, when he was ready to start,
      after finding room in his swag for a couple of books, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      sorry I struck this camp;&rdquo; but whether because of the cabbage, or
      the woman, or the books, he did not say. Let us hope it was because of the
      woman, and the books, and the cabbage, with the cabbage placed last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with a pull at his hat, and a &ldquo;good-bye, ma&rsquo;am, good
      luck,&rdquo; the man from Beyanst rode out of the gundy camp, and out of
      our lives, to become one of its pleasant memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man from Beyanst was our only visitor for the first week, in that
      camp, and then after that we had some one every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan went into the homestead for stores, and set the ball rolling by
      returning at sundown in triumph with a great find: a lady traveller, the
      wife of one of the Inland Telegraph masters. Her husband and little son
      were with her, but&mdash;well, they were only men. It was five months
      since I had seen a white woman, and all I saw at the time was a woman
      riding towards our camp. I wonder what she saw as <i>I </i>came to meet <i>her</i>
      through the leafy bough gundies. It was nearly two years since she had
      seen a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a merry camp that night&mdash;merry and beautiful and picturesque.
      The night was very cold and brilliantly starry, as nights usually are in
      the Never-Never during the Dry; the camp fires were all around us: dozens
      of them, grouped in and out among the gundies, and among the fires&mdash;chatting,
      gossiping groups of happy-hearted human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around one central fire sat the lubras, with an outer circle of smaller
      fires behind them: one central fire and one fire behind each lubra, for
      such is the wisdom of the black folk; they warm themselves both back and
      front. Within another circle of fires chirruped and gossiped the &ldquo;boys,&rdquo;
      while around an immense glowing heap of logs sat the white folk&mdash;the
      &ldquo;big fellow fools&rdquo; of the party, with scorching faces and
      freezing backs, too conservative to learn wisdom from their humbler
      neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At our fireside we women did most of the talking, and as we sat chatting
      on every subject under the sun, our husbands looked on in indulgent
      amusement. Dan soon wearied of the fleeting conversation and turned in,
      and the little lad slipped away to the black folk; but late into the night
      we talked: late into the night, and all the next day and evening and
      following morning&mdash;shaded from the brilliant sunshine all day in the
      leafy &ldquo;Cottage,&rdquo; and scorching around the camp fire during the
      evenings. And then these travellers, too, passed out of our camp to
      become, with the man from Beyanst, just pleasant memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find mere men unsatisfying after this,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      said in farewell, and a mere man coming in from the north-west before
      sundown, greeted the M&#259;luka with: &ldquo;Thought you married a towny,&rdquo;
      as he pointed with eloquent forefinger at our supper circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka laughed back. &ldquo;But before I
      had time to dazzle the bushies with her the Wizard of the Never-Never
      charmed her into a bush-whacker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into a&nbsp;<i>charming&nbsp;</i>bush-whacker, he&nbsp;<i>means</i>!&rdquo;
      the traveller said, bowing before his introduction; and I wondered how the
      M&#259;luka could have thought for one moment that &ldquo;mere men&rdquo;
      would prove unsatisfying. But as I acknowledged the gallantry Dan looked
      on dubiously, not sure whether pretty speeches were a help or a hindrance
      to education.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one could call the Fizzer a &ldquo;mere man&rdquo;; and half-past
      eleven four weeks being already past, the Fizzer was even then at the
      homestead, and before another midday, came shouting into our camp, and,
      settling down to dinner, kept the conversational ball rolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to be a record Dry,&rdquo; he assured us&mdash;&ldquo;all
      surface water gone along the line already&rdquo;; and then he hurled
      various items of news at us: &ldquo;the horse teams were managing to do a
      good trip; and Mac? Oh, Mac&rsquo;s getting along,&rdquo; he shouted;
      &ldquo;struck him on a dry stage; seemed a bit light-headed; said dry
      stages weren&rsquo;t all beer and skittles&mdash;queer idea. Beer and
      skittles! He won&rsquo;t find much beer on dry stages, and I reckon the
      man&rsquo;s dilly that &rsquo;ud play a game of skittles on any one of
      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was all right down the line! But the Fizzer was always a bird of
      passage, and by the time dinner was over, and a few postscripts added to
      the mail, he was ready to start, and rode off, promising the best mail the
      &ldquo;Territory could produce in a fortnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Other travellers followed the Fizzer, and the cooking lessons proceeded
      until the fine art of making &ldquo;puff de looneys,&rdquo; sinkers, and
      doughboys had been mastered, and then, before the camp had time to grow
      monotonous, the staff appeared with a few of the station pups. &ldquo;Might
      it missus like puppy dog,&rdquo; it said to explain its presence hinting
      also that the missus might require a little clothes-washing done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, washing-days at the homestead had lost all their vim, for the
      creek having stopped running, washing had to be conducted in tubs, so as
      to keep the billabong clear for drinking purposes. But at the Springs
      there was no necessity to think of anything but running water; and after a
      happy day, Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie, Rosy, and Biddy returned to the
      homestead&mdash;the goats had to be seen to, Nellie said, thinking nothing
      of a twenty-seven-mile walk in a day, with a few hours&rsquo; washing for
      recreation in between whiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the staff, a shadow or two, and the puppy dogs, filled in all time
      until the yard was pronounced finished then a mob of cattle was brought in
      and put through to test its strength; and just as we were preparing to
      return to the homestead the Dandy&rsquo;s waggon lumbered into camp with
      its loading of stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A box of new books kept us busy all afternoon, and then, before sundown,
      the M&#259;luka suggested a farewell stroll among the pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bitter Springs&mdash;a chain of clear, crystal pools, a long winding
      chain, doubling back on itself in loops and curves&mdash;form the source
      of the permanent flow of the Roper; pools only a few feet deep, irregular
      and wide-spreading, with mossy-green, deeply undermined, overhanging
      banks, and lime-stone bottoms washed into terraces that gleam azure-blue
      through the transparent water.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little rank grass along their borders, no sign of water-lilies,
      and few weeds within them; clumps of palms dotted here and there among the
      light timber, and everywhere sun-flecked, warm, dry shade. Nowhere is
      there a hint of that sinister suggestion of the Reach. Clear, beautiful,
      limpid, wide-spreading, irregular pools, set in an undulating field of
      emerald-green mossy surf, shaded with graceful foliage and gleaming in the
      sunlight with exquisite opal tints&mdash;a giant necklace of opals, set in
      links of emerald green, and thrown down at hazard to fall in loops and
      curves within a forest grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in appearance only the pools are isolated; for although many feet
      apart in some instances, they are linked together throughout by a shallow
      underground river, that runs over a rocky bed; while the turf, that looks
      so solid in many places, is barely a two-foot crust arched over five or
      six feet of space and water&mdash;a deathtrap for heavy cattle; but a
      place of interest to white folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka and I wandered aimlessly in and out among the pools for a
      while, and, then coming out unexpectedly from a piece of bush, found
      ourselves face to face with a sight that froze all movement out of us for
      a moment&mdash;the living, moving head of a horse, standing upright from
      the turf on a few inches of neck: a grey, uncanny, bodyless head,
      nickering piteously at us as it stood on the turf at our feet. I have
      never seen a ghost, but I know exactly how I will feel if ever I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we stood spellbound with horror, and the next, realising what
      had happened, were kneeling down beside the piteous head. The thin crust
      of earth had given way beneath the animal&rsquo;s hindquarters as it
      grazed over the turf, and before it could recover itself it had slipped
      bodily through the hole thus formed, and was standing on the rocky bed of
      the underground river, with its head only in the upper air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor brute was perishing for want of food and water. All around the
      hole, as far as the head could reach, the turf was eaten, bare, and
      although it was standing in a couple of feet of water it could not get at
      it. While the M&#259;luka went for help I brought handfuls of grass, and
      his hat full of water, again and again, and was haunted for days with the
      remembrance of those pleading eyes and piteous, nickering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole camp, black and white, came to the rescue but it was an awful
      work getting the exhausted creature out of its death-trap. The hole had to
      be cut back to a solid ridge of rocky soil, saplings cut to form a solid
      slope from the bed of the river to the ground above, and the poor brute
      roped and literally hauled up the slope by sheer force and strength of
      numbers. After an hour&rsquo;s digging, dragging, and rope-pulling, the
      horse was standing on solid turf, a new pool had been added to the
      Springs, and none of us had much hankering for riding over springy
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour&rsquo;s work among the pools awakened the latent geologist in all
      of us, excepting Dan, and set us rooting at the bottom of one of the pools
      for a piece of the terraced limestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to dislodge, and our efforts reminded Dan of a night
      spent in the camp of a geologist&mdash;a man with many letters after his
      name. &ldquo;Had the chaps heaving rocks round for him half his time,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t see much sense in it meself.&rdquo; Dan
      spoke of the geologist as &ldquo;one of them old Alphabets.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never
      met a chap with so many letters in his brand,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He
      was one of them taxydermy blokes, you know, that&rsquo;s always messing
      round with stones and things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the water, the opal tints died out of the limestone, and the
      geologist in us went to sleep again when we found that all we had for our
      trouble was a piece of dirty-looking rock. Like Dan, we saw little sense
      in &ldquo;heaving rocks round,&rdquo; and went back to the camp and the
      business of packing up for the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      About next midday we rode into the homestead thoroughfare, where Cheon and
      Tiddle&rsquo;ums welcomed us with enthusiasm, but Cheon&rsquo;s enthusiasm
      turned to indignation when he found we were only in for a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;er matter?&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Missus
      no more stockrider&rdquo;; but a letter waiting for us at the homestead
      made &ldquo;bush&rdquo; more than ever imperative: a letter, from the
      foreman of the telegraphic repairing line party, asking for a mob of
      killers, and fixing a date for its delivery to one &ldquo;Happy Dick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoke just in the nick of time,&rdquo; Dan said; but as we
      discussed plans Cheon hinted darkly that the M&#259;luka was not a fit and
      proper person to be entrusted with the care of a woman, and suggested that
      he should undertake to treat the missus as she should be treated, while
      the M&#259;luka attended to the cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate, however, interfered to keep the missus at the homestead, to persuade
      Cheon that, after all, the M&#259;luka was a fit and proper person to have
      the care of a woman, and to find a very present use for the house; an
      influenza sore-throat breaking out in the camp, the missus developed it,
      and Dan went out alone to find the Quiet Stockman and the &ldquo;killers&rdquo;
      for Happy Dick.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter15" id="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before a week was out the M&#259;luka and Cheon had won each other&rsquo;s
      undying regard because of their treatment of the missus.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the nearest doctor three hundred miles away in Darwin, and held there
      by hospital routine, the M&#259;luka decided on bed and feeding-up as the
      safest course, and Cheon came out in a new character.
    </p>
    <p>
      As medical adviser and reader-aloud to the patient, the M&#259;luka was
      supposed to have his hands full, and Cheon, usurping the position of
      sick-nurse, sent everything, excepting the nursing, to the wall.
      Rice-water, chicken-jelly, barley-water, egg-flips, beef-tea junket, and
      every invalid food he had ever heard of, were prepared, and, with the M&#259;luka
      to back him up, forced on the missus; and when food was not being
      administered, the pillow was being shaken or the bedclothes straightened.
      (The mattress being still on the ends of cows&rsquo; tails, a folded rug
      served in its place). There was very little wrong with the patient, but
      the wonder was she did not become really ill through over-eating and want
      of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pleaded with the M&#259;luka, but the M&#259;luka pleading for just a
      little more rest and feeding-up, while Cheon gulped and choked in the
      background, I gave in, and eating everything as it was offered, snatched
      what rest I could, getting as much entertainment as possible out of Cheon
      and the staff in between times.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days I lay obediently patient, and each day Cheon grew more
      affectionate, patting my hands at times, as he confided to the M&#259;luka
      that although he admired big, moon-faced women as a feast for the eyes, he
      liked them small and docile when he had to deal personally with them.
      Until I met Cheon I thought the Chinese incapable of affection; but many
      lessons are learned out bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travellers&mdash;house-visitors&mdash;coming in on the fourth day, I hoped
      for a speedy release, but visitors were considered fatiguing, and release
      was promised as soon as they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the walls had many cracks in them&mdash;not being as much on
      the plumb as Johnny had predicted, and for a couple of days, watching the
      visitors through these cracks and listening to their conversation provided
      additional amusement. I could see them quite distinctly as, no doubt, they
      could see me; but we kept a decorous silence until the Fizzer came in,
      then at the Fizzer&rsquo;s shout the walls of Jericho toppled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The missus sick!&rdquo; I heard him shout. &ldquo;Thought she
      looked in prime condition at the Springs.&rdquo; (Bush language frequently
      has a strong twang of cattle in it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am now,&rdquo; I called; and then the Fizzer and I held an
      animated conversation through the walls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m imprisoned for
      life,&rdquo; I moaned, after hearing the news of the outside world; and
      laughing and chuckling outside, the Fizzer vowed he would &ldquo;do a
      rescue next trip if they&rsquo;ve still got you down.&rdquo; Then, after
      appreciating fervent thanks, he shouted in farewell: &ldquo;The boss is
      bringing something along that&rsquo;ll help to pass some of the time&mdash;the
      finest mail you ever clapped eyes on,&rdquo; and presently patient and bed
      were under a litter of mail-matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fizzer having brought down the walls of conventionality, the
      traveller-guests proffered greetings and sympathy through the material
      walls, after which we exchanged mail-news and general gossip for a day or
      two; then just as these travellers were preparing to exchange farewells,
      others came in and postponed the promised release. As there seemed little
      hope of a lull in visitors, I was wondering if ever I should be considered
      well enough to entertain guests, when Fate once more interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s this coming in from the East?&rdquo; I heard the M&#259;luka
      call in consternation, and in equal consternation his traveller-guest
      called back: &ldquo;Looks like a whole village settlement.&rdquo; Then
      Cheon burst into the room in a frenzy of excitement: &ldquo;Big mob
      traveller, missus. Two-fellow-missus, sit down,&rdquo; he began; but the M&#259;luka
      was at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s two women and a mob of youngsters,&rdquo; he gasped.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to get up, little &rsquo;un, and
      lend a hand with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Afraid! By the time the village settlement had &ldquo;turned out&rdquo;
      and found its way to the house, I was out in the open air welcoming its
      members with a heartiness that must have surprised them. Little did they
      guess that they were angels unaware. Homely enough angels, though, they
      proved, as angels unaware should prove: one man and two women from &ldquo;Queensland
      way,&rdquo; who had been &ldquo;inside&rdquo; for fifteen years, and with
      them two fine young lads and a wee, toddling baby&mdash;all three children
      born in the bush and leaving it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Cheon had such a company to provide for; but as we moved
      towards the house in a body&mdash;ourselves, the village settlement, and
      the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s traveller-guests, with a stockman traveller and
      the Dandy looking on from the quarters, his hospitable soul rejoiced at
      the sight; and by the time seats had been found for all comers, he
      appeared laden with tea and biscuits, and within half an hour had conjured
      up a plentiful dinner for all comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the chairs were all &ldquo;up&rdquo; to the weight of the
      ladies, and the remainder of the company easily accommodated itself to
      circumstances, in the shape of sawn stumps, rough stools, and sundry
      boxes; and although the company was large and the dining-table small, and
      although, at times, we feared the table was about to fulfil its
      oft-repeated threat and fall over, yet the dinner was there to be enjoyed,
      and, being bush-folk, and hungry, our guests enjoyed it, passing over all
      incongruities with simple merriment&mdash;a light-hearted, bubbling
      merriment, in no way comparable to that &ldquo;laughter of fools,&rdquo;
      that crackling of thorns under a pot, provoked by the incongruities of the
      world&rsquo;s freak dinners. The one is the heritage of the
      simple-hearted, and the other&mdash;all the world has to give in exchange
      for this birthright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder lads, one fourteen and one ten years of age, found Cheon by far
      the most entertaining incongruity at the dinner, and when dinner was over&mdash;after
      we had settled down on the various chairs and stumps that had been carried
      out to the verandah again&mdash;they shadowed him wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were strangely self-possessed children; but knowing little more of
      the world than the black children their playmates, Cheon, in his turn,
      found them vastly amusing, and instructing them in the ways of the world&mdash;from
      his point of view&mdash;found them also eager pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their education came to a standstill after they had mastered the
      mysteries of the Dandy&rsquo;s gramophone, and Cheon was no longer
      entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon brass-band selections, comic songs, and variety items,
      blared out with ceaseless reiteration; and as the men-folk smoked and
      talked cattle, and the wee baby&mdash;a bonnie fair child&mdash;toddled
      about, smiling and contented, the women-folk spoke of their life &ldquo;out-back,&rdquo;
      and listening, I knew that neither I nor the telegraph lady had even
      guessed what roughness means.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fifteen years things had been improving, and now everyone was to have
      a well-earned holiday. The children were to be christened and then shown
      the delights of a large town! Darwin of necessity (Palmerston, by the way,
      on the map, but Darwin to Territorians). Darwin with its one train, its
      telegraph offices, two or three stores, banks and public buildings, its
      Residency, its Chinatown, its lovers&rsquo; walk, its two or three empty,
      wide, grass-grown streets bordered with deep-verandahed, iron-built
      bungalow-houses, with their gardens planted in painted tins&mdash;a
      development of the white-ant pest&mdash;and lastly, its great sea, where
      ships wander without tracks or made ways! Hardly a typical town, but the
      best in the Territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women, naturally, were looking forward to doing a bit of shopping, and
      as we slipped into fashions the traveller guests became interested.
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen so many women together for years,&rdquo; one of
      them said. &ldquo;Reminds me of when I was a nipper,&rdquo; and the other
      traveller &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo; he had struck it lucky for once. &ldquo;Three
      on &rsquo;em at once,&rdquo; he chuckled with indescribable relish.
      &ldquo;They reckon it never rains but it pours.&rdquo; And so it would
      seem with three women guests within three weeks at a homestead where women
      had been almost unknown for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these women guests only stayed one night, the children being all
      impatience to get on to the telegraph line, to those wires that talked,
      and to the railway, where the iron monster ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning they left us, and as they rode away the fair toddling
      baby was sitting on its mother&rsquo;s pommel-knee, smiling out on the
      world from the deep recesses of a sunbonnet. Already it had ridden a
      couple of hundred miles, with its baby hands playing with the reins, and
      before it reached home again another five hundred would be added to the
      two hundred. Seven hundred miles on horse back in a few weeks, at one year
      old, compares favourably with one of the Fizzer&rsquo;s trips. But it is
      thus the bush develops her Fizzers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After so much excitement Cheon feared a relapse, and was for prompt,
      preventive measures; but even the M&#259;luka felt there was a limit to
      the Rest Cure, and the musterers coming in with Happy Dick&rsquo;s
      bullocks and a great mob of mixed cattle for the yards, Dan proved a
      strong ally; and besides, as the musterers were in and Happy Dick due to
      arrive by midday, Cheon&rsquo;s hands were full with other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a roly-poly pudding to make for Dan, baked custard for the
      Dandy, jam-tarts for Happy Dick, cake and biscuits for all comers, in
      addition to a dinner and supper waiting to be cooked for fifteen black
      boys, several lubras, and half-a-dozen hungry white folk. Cheon had his
      own peculiar form of welcome for his many favourites, regaling each one of
      them with delicacies to their particular liking, each and every time they
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Dick, also, had his own peculiar form of welcome. &ldquo;Good-day!
      Real glad to see you!&rdquo; was <i>his</i> usual greeting. Sure of his
      own welcome wherever he went, he never waited to hear it, but hastened to
      welcome all men into his fellowship. &ldquo;Real glad to see you,&rdquo;
      he would say, with a ready smile of comradeship; and it always seemed as
      though he had added: &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll make yourself at home
      while with me.&rdquo; In some mysterious way, Happy Dick was at all times
      the host giving liberally of the best he had to his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of the pillars of the Line Party. &ldquo;Born in it, I think,&rdquo;
      he would say. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quite remember,&rdquo; adding with his
      ever-varying smile, &ldquo;Remember when it was born, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the &ldquo;Overland Telegraph&rdquo; was built across the Australian
      continent from sea to sea, a clear broad avenue two chains wide, was cut
      for it through bush and scrub and dense forests, along the backbone of
      Australia, and in this avenue the line party was &ldquo;born&rdquo; and
      bred&mdash;a party of axemen and mechanics under the orders of a foreman,
      whose duty it is to keep the &ldquo;Territory section&rdquo; of the line
      in repair, and this avenue free from the scrub and timber that spring up
      unceasingly in its length.
    </p>
    <p>
      In unbroken continuity this great avenue runs for hundreds upon hundreds
      of miles, carpeted with feathery grasses and shooting scrubs, and walled
      in on either side with dense, towering forest or lighter and more
      scattered timber. On and on it stretches in utter loneliness, zigzagging
      from horizon to horizons beyond, and guarding those two sensitive wires at
      its centre, as they run along their single line of slender galvanised
      posts, from the great bush that never ceases in its efforts to close in on
      them and engulf them. A great broad highway, waiting in its loneliness for
      the generations to come, with somewhere in its length the line party camp,
      and here and there within its thousand miles, a chance traveller or two
      here and there a horseman with pack-horse ambling and grazing along behind
      him; here and there a trudging speck with a swag across its shoulders, and
      between them one, two, or three hundred miles of solitude, here and there
      a horseman riding, and here and there a footman trudging on, each
      unconscious of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      From day to day they travel on, often losing the count of the days, with
      those lines always above them, and those beckoning posts ever running on
      before them and as they travel, now and then they touch a post for company&mdash;shaking
      hands with Outside: touching now and then a post for company, and daily
      realising the company and comfort those posts and wires can be. Here at
      least is something in touch with the world something vibrating with the
      lives and actions of men, and an ever-present friend in dire necessity.
      With those wires above him, any day a traveller can cry for help to the
      Territory, if he call while he yet has strength to climb one of those
      friendly posts and cut that quivering wire&mdash;for help that will come
      speedily, for the cutting of the telegraph wire is as the ringing of an
      alarm-bell throughout the Territory. In all haste the break is located,
      and food, water, and every human help that suggests itself sent out from
      the nearest telegraph station. There is no official delay&mdash;there
      rarely is in the Territory&mdash;for by some marvellous good fortune,
      there everything belongs to the Department in which it finds itself.

      Just as Happy Dick is one of the pillars of the line party, so the line
      party is one of the pillars of the line itself. Up and down this great
      avenue, year in year out it creeps along, cutting scrub and repairing as
      it goes, and moving cumbrous main camps from time to time, with its waggon
      loads of stores, tents, furnishings, flocks of milking goats, its fowls,
      its gramophone, and Chinese cook. Month after month it creeps on, until,
      reaching the end of the section, it turns round to creep out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Year in, year out, it had crept in and out, and for twenty years Happy
      Dick had seen to its peace and comfort. Nothing ever ruffled him. &ldquo;All
      in the game&rdquo; was his nearest approach to a complaint, as he pegged
      away at his work, in between whiles going to the nearest station for
      killers, carting water in tanks out to &ldquo;dry stage camps,&rdquo; and
      doing any other work that found itself undone. Dick&rsquo;s position was
      as elastic as his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered himself an authority on three things only: the line party,
      dog-fights, and cribbage. All else, including his dog Peter and his
      cheque-book, he left to the discretion of his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter&mdash;a speckled, drab-coloured, prick-eared creation, a few sizes
      larger than a fox-terrier&mdash;could be kept in order with a little
      discretion, and by keeping hands off Happy Dick; but all the discretion in
      the Territory, and a unanimous keeping off of hands, failed to keep order
      in the cheque-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal payment of salaries to men scattered through hundreds of
      miles of bush country being impracticable, the department pays all
      salaries due to its servants into their bank accounts at Darwin, and
      therefore when Happy Dick found himself the backbone of the line party, he
      also found himself the possessor of a cheque-book. At first he was
      inclined to look upon it as a poor substitute for hard cash; but after the
      foreman had explained its mysteries, and taught him to sign his name in
      magic tracery, he became more than reconciled to it and drew cheques
      blithely, until one for five pounds was returned to a creditor: no funds&mdash;and
      in due course returned to Happy Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good?&rdquo; he said to the creditor, looking critically at the
      piece of paper in his hands. &ldquo;Must have been writ wrong. Well, you&rsquo;ve
      only yourself to blame, seeing you wrote it&rdquo;; then added
      magnanimously, mistaking the creditor&rsquo;s scorn: &ldquo;Never mind,
      write yourself out another. I don&rsquo;t mind signing &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman and the creditor spent several hours trying to explain banking
      principles, but Dick &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      stacks of &rsquo;em left!&rdquo; he persisted, showing his book of
      fluttering bank cheques. Finally, in despair, the foreman took the
      cheque-book into custody, and Dick found himself poor once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only for a little while. In an evil hour he discovered that a
      cheque from another man&rsquo;s book answered all purposes if it bore that
      magic tracery, and Happy Dick was never solvent again. Gaily he signed
      cheques, and the foreman did all he could to keep pace with him on the
      cheque-book block; but as no one, excepting the accountant in the Darwin
      bank, knew the state of his account from day to day, it was like taking a
      ticket in a lottery to accept a cheque from Happy Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real glad to see you,&rdquo; Happy Dick said in hearty greeting to
      us all as he dismounted, and we waited to be entertained. Happy Dick had
      his favourite places and people, and the Elsey community stood high in his
      favour. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t beat the Elsey for a good dog-fight and a good
      game of cribbage,&rdquo; he said, every time he came in or left us, and
      that from Happy Dick was high praise. At times he added: &ldquo;Nor for a
      square meal neither,&rdquo; thereby inciting Cheon to further triumphs for
      his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, Happy Dick &ldquo;played&rdquo; the Quarters cribbage and
      related a good dog-fight&mdash;&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;&mdash;and,
      as usual before he left us, his pockets were bulging with tobacco&mdash;the
      highest stakes used in the Quarters&mdash;and Peter and Brown had
      furnished him with materials for a still newer dog-fight recital. As
      usual, he rode off with his killers, assuring all that he would &ldquo;be
      along again soon,&rdquo; and, as usual, Peter and Brown were tattered and
      <i>hors-de-combat</i>, but both still aggressive. Peter&rsquo;s death
      lunge was the death lunge of Brown, and both dogs knew that lunge too well
      to let the other &ldquo;get in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, Happy Dick had hunted through the store, and taken anything he
      &ldquo;really needed,&rdquo; paying, of course, by cheque; but when he
      came to sign that cheque, after the M&#259;luka had written it, he entered
      the dining-room for the first time since its completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      With calm scrutiny he took in every detail, including the serviettes as
      they lay folded in their rings on the waiting dinner-table, and before he
      left the homestead he expressed his approval in the Quarters:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got everything up to the knocker, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Often heard toffs decorated their tables with rags in hobble
      rings, but never believed it before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Dick gone, Cheon turned his attention to the health of the missus;
      but Dan, persuading the M&#259;luka that &ldquo;all she needed was a
      breath of fresh air,&rdquo; we went bush on a tour of inspection.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter16" id="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within a week we returned to the homestead, and for twenty-four hours
      Cheon gloated over us, preparing every delicacy that appealed to him as an
      antidote to an outbush course of beef and damper. Then a man rode into our
      lives who was to teach us the depth and breadth of the meaning of the word
      mate&mdash;a sturdy, thick-set man with haggard, tired eyes and deep lines
      about his firm strong mouth that told of recent and prolonged tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me mate&rsquo;s sick; got a touch of fever,&rdquo; he said simply
      dismounting near the verandah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left him camped back
      there at the Warlochs&rdquo;; and as the M&#259;luka prepared remedies&mdash;making
      up the famous Gulf mixture&mdash;the man with grateful thanks, found room
      in his pockets and saddle-pouch for eggs, milk, and brandy, confident that
      &ldquo;these&rsquo;ll soon put him right,&rdquo; adding, with the tense
      lines deepening about his mouth as he touched on what had brought them
      there: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been real bad, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ve had a bit
      of a job to get him as far as this.&rdquo; In the days to come we were to
      learn, little by little, that the &ldquo;bit of a job&rdquo; had meant
      keeping a sick man in his saddle for the greater part of the fifty-mile
      dry stage, with forty miles of &ldquo;bad going&rdquo; on top of that, and
      fighting for him every inch of the way that terrible symptom of malaria&mdash;that
      longing to &ldquo;chuck it,&rdquo; and lie down and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad water after that fifty-mile dry made men with a touch of fever only
      too common at the homestead, and knowing how much the comforts of the
      homestead could do, when the M&#259;luka came out with the medicines he
      advised bringing the sick man on as soon as he had rested sufficiently.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to ask for it and we&rsquo;ll send the old
      station buck-board across,&rdquo; he said, and the man began fumbling
      uneasily at his saddle-girths, and said something evasive about &ldquo;giving
      trouble&rdquo;; but when the M&#259;luka&mdash;afraid that a man&rsquo;s
      life might be the forfeit of another man&rsquo;s shrinking fear of causing
      trouble&mdash;added that on second thoughts we would ride across as soon
      as horses could be brought in, he flushed hotly and stammered: &ldquo;If
      you please, ma&rsquo;am. If the boss&rsquo;ll excuse me, me mate&rsquo;s
      dead-set against a woman doing things for him. If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
      not coming. He&rsquo;d rather have me. Me and him&rsquo;s been mates this
      seven years. The boss&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boss did understand, and rode across to the Warlochs alone, to find a
      man as shy and reticent as a bushman can be, and full of dread lest the
      woman at the homestead would insist on visiting him. &ldquo;You see, that&rsquo;s
      why he wouldn&rsquo;t come on,&rdquo; the mate said. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t
      bear the thought of a woman doing things for him&rdquo;; and the M&#259;luka
      explained that the missus understood all that. That lesson had been easily
      learned; for again and again men had come in &ldquo;down with a touch of
      fever,&rdquo; whose temperatures went up at the very thought of a woman
      doing things for them, and always the actual nursing was left to the M&#259;luka
      or the Dandy, the woman seeing to egg-flips and such things, exchanging at
      first perhaps only an occasional greeting, and listening at times to
      strange life-histories later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in vain the M&#259;luka explained and entreated: the sick man was
      &ldquo;all right where he was.&rdquo; His mate was worth &ldquo;ten women
      fussing round,&rdquo; he insisted, ignoring the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      explanations. &ldquo;Had he not lugged him through the worst pinch
      already?&rdquo; and then he played his trump card: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
      stick to me till I peg out,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;nothing&rsquo;s
      too tough for him&rdquo;; and as he lay back, the mate deciding &ldquo;arguing&rsquo;ll
      only do for him,&rdquo; dismissed the M&#259;luka with many thanks,
      refusing all offers of nursing help with a quiet &ldquo;He&rsquo;d rather
      have me,&rdquo; but accepting gratefully broths and milk and anything of
      that sort the homestead could furnish. &ldquo;Nothing ever knocks me out,&rdquo;
      he reiterated, and dragged on through sleepless days and nights, as the
      days dragged by finding ample reward in the knowledge that &ldquo;he&rsquo;d
      rather have me&rdquo;, and when there came that deep word of praise from
      his stricken comrade: &ldquo;A good mate&rsquo;s harder to find than a
      good wife,&rdquo; his gentle, protecting devotion increased tenfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bushmen are instinctively protective. There is no other word that so
      exactly defines their tender helpfulness to all weakness and helplessness.
      Knowing how hard the fight is out-bush for even the strong and enduring
      all their magnificent strength and courage stand ready for those who would
      go to the wall without it. A lame dog, a man down in his luck, an old
      soaker, little women, any woman in need or sickness&mdash;each and all
      call forth this protectiveness; but nothing calls it forth in all its
      self-sacrificing tenderness like the helplessness of a strong man stricken
      down in his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this also, we stood aside, and rejoicing as the sick man,
      benefiting by the comparative comfort and satisfied to have his own way,
      seemed to improve. For three days he improved steadily, and then, after
      standing still for another day slipped back inch by inch to weakness and
      prostration, until the homestead, without coercion, was the only chance
      for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a woman there; and as the mate went back to his pleading the
      woman did what the world may consider a strange thing&mdash;but a man&rsquo;s
      life depended on it&mdash;she sent a message out to the sick man, to say
      that if he would come to the homestead she would not go to him until he
      asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered over the message for a day, sceptical of a woman&rsquo;s word&mdash;surely
      some woman had left that legacy in his heart&mdash;but eventually decided
      he wouldn&rsquo;t risk it. Then the chief of the telegraph coming in&mdash;a
      man widely experienced in fever&mdash;and urging one more attempt, the
      Dandy volunteered to help us in our extremity, and, driving across to the
      Warlochs in the chief&rsquo;s buggy worked one of his miracles; he spent
      only a few minutes alone with the man (and the Dandy alone knows now what
      passed), but within an hour the sick traveller was resting quietly between
      clean sheets in the Dandy&rsquo;s bed. There were times when the links in
      the chain seemed all blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waking warm and refreshed, the sick man faced the battle of life once
      more, and the chief taking command, and the man quietly and hopefully
      obeying orders, the woman found her promise easy to keep; but the mate&rsquo;s
      hardest task had come, the task of waiting with folded hands. With the
      same quiet steadfastness he braced himself for this task and when, after
      weary hours, the chief pronounced &ldquo;all well&rdquo; and turned to him
      with an encouraging &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll pull through now, my man,&rdquo;
      the sturdy shoulders that had borne so much drooped and quivered beneath
      the kindly words, and with dimming eyes he gave in at last to the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      persuasions, and lay down and slept, sure of the Dandy&rsquo;s promise to
      wake him at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the M&#259;luka left the Quarters, and going back just before
      the dawn to relieve the Dandy, found the sick man lying quietly-restful,
      with one arm thrown lightly across his brow. He had spoken in his sleep a
      short while before the Dandy said as the M&#259;luka bent over him with a
      cup of warm milk, but the cup was returned to the table untasted. Many
      travellers had come into our lives and passed on with a bright nod of
      farewell; but at the first stirring of the dawn, without one word of
      farewell, this traveller had passed on and left us; left us, and the
      faithful mate of those seven strong young years and those last few days of
      weariness. &ldquo;Unexpected heart failure,&rdquo; our chief said, as the
      Dandy went to fulfil his promise to the sleeping mate. He promised to
      waken him at the dawn, and leaving that awakening in the Dandy&rsquo;s
      hands, as we thought of that lonely Warloch camp our one great
      thankfulness was that when the awakening came the man was not to be alone
      there with his dead comrade. The bush can be cruel at times, and yet,
      although she may leave us alone with our beloved dead, her very cruelty
      brings with it a fierce, consoling pain; for out-bush our dead are all our
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond those seven faithful years the mate could tell us but little of his
      comrade&rsquo;s life. He was William Neaves, born at Woolongong, with a
      mother living somewhere there. That was all he knew. &ldquo;He was always
      a reticent chap,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;He never wanted any one but
      me about him,&rdquo; and the unspoken request was understood. He was <i>his</i>
      mate, and no one but himself must render the last services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry-eyed and worn, the man moved about, doing all that should be done, the
      bushmen only helping where they dared; then shouldering a pick and shovel,
      he went to the tattle rise beyond the slip rails, and set doggedly to work
      at a little distance from two lonely graves already there. Doggedly he
      worked on; but, as he worked, gradually his burden lost its overwhelming
      weight, for the greater part of it had somehow skipped on to the Dandy&rsquo;s
      shoulders&mdash;those brave, unflinching shoulders, that carried other men&rsquo;s
      burdens so naturally and so willingly that their burdens always seemed the
      Dandy&rsquo;s own. The Dandy may have had that power of finding &ldquo;something
      decent&rdquo; in every one he met, but in the Dandy all men found the help
      they needed most.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="page212" id="page212"></a>
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Quietly and unassumingly, the Dandy put all in order and then, soon after
      midday, with brilliant sunshine all about us, we stood by an open grave in
      the shade of the drooping glory of a crimson flowering bauhenia. Some
      scenes live undimmed in our memories for a lifetime&mdash;scenes where we
      have seemed onlookers rather than actors seeing every detail with minute
      exactness&mdash;and that scene with its mingling of glorious beauty, human
      pathos, and soft, subdued sound, will live, I think, in the memory of most
      of us for many years to come:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the midst of life we are in death,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka read,
      standing among that drooping crimson splendour and at his feet lay the
      open grave, preaching silently its great lesson of Life and Death, with,
      beside it, the still quiet form of the traveller whose last weary journey
      had ended; around it, bareheaded and all in white, a little band of
      bush-folk, silent and reverent and awed; above it, that crimson glory, and
      all around and about it, soft sun-flecked bush, murmuring sounds, flooding
      sunshine, and deep azure blue distances. Beyond the bush, deep azure blue,
      within it and throughout it, flooding sunshine and golden ladders of
      light; and at its sun-flecked heart, under that drooping crimson-starred
      canopy of soft grey-green, that little company of bush-folk, standing
      beside that open grave, as Mother Nature, strewing with flowers the last
      resting place of one of her children, scattered gently falling scarlet
      blossoms into it and about it. Here and there a dog lay, stretched out in
      the shade, sniffing in idle curiosity at the blossoms as they fell, well
      satisfied with what life had to give just then; while at their master&rsquo;s
      feet lay the traveller who was to leave such haunting memories behind him:
      William Neaves, born at Woolongong, with somewhere there a mother going
      quietly about her work, wondering vaguely perhaps where her laddie was
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor mother! Yet, when even that knowledge came to her, it comforted her
      in her sorrow to know that a woman had stood beside that grave mourning
      for her boy in her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly the M&#259;luka read on to the end; and then in the hush that
      followed the mate stooped, and, with deep lines hardening rigidly, picked
      up a spade. There was no mistaking his purpose; but as he straightened
      himself the Dandy&rsquo;s hand was on the spade and the M&#259;luka was
      speaking. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be good enough to drive the missus
      back to the house right away,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I think she has
      had almost more than she can stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked hesitatingly at him. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be good enough,&rdquo;
      the M&#259;luka added, &ldquo;I should not leave here myself till all is
      completed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unerringly the M&#259;luka had read his man: no hint of <i>his</i>
      strength failing, but a favour asked, and with it a service for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stern set lines about the man&rsquo;s mouth quivered for a moment,
      then set again as he sacrificed his wishes to a woman&rsquo;s need, and
      relinquishing the spade, turned away; and as we drove down to the house in
      the chief&rsquo;s buggy&mdash;the buggy that a few minutes before had
      borne our sick traveller along that last stage of his earthly journey&mdash;he
      said gently, almost apologetically: &ldquo;I should have reckoned on this
      knocking you out a bit, missus.&rdquo; Always others, never self, with the
      bush-folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, this service rendered for the man who had done what he could for his
      comrade, his strong, unflinching heart turned back to its labour of love,
      and, all else being done, found relief for itself in softening and
      smoothing the rough outline of the newly piled mound, and as the man
      toiled, Mother Nature went on with her work, silently and sweetly healing
      the scar on her bosom, hiding her pain from the world, as she shrouded in
      starry crimson the burial place of her brave, enduring son&mdash;a service
      to be renewed from day to day until the mosses and grasses grew again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were still other services for the mate to render and as the
      bush-folk stood aside, none daring to trespass here, a rough wooden
      railing rose about the grave. Then the man packed his comrade&rsquo;s swag
      for the last time, and that done, came to the M&#259;luka, as we stood
      under the house verandah, and held out two sovereigns in his open palm.
      The man was yet a stranger to the ways of the Never-Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask for tick for meself for awhile,&rdquo; he
      said &ldquo;But if that won&rsquo;t pay for all me mate&rsquo;s had there&rsquo;s
      another where they came from. He was always independent and would never
      take charity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard lines about his mouth were very marked just then, and the
      outstretched hand seemed fiercely defiant but the M&#259;luka reading in
      it only a man&rsquo;s proud care for a comrade&rsquo;s honour, put it
      gently aside, saying: &ldquo;We give no charity here; only hospitality to
      our guests. Surely no man would refuse that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They speak of a woman&rsquo;s delicate tact. But daily the bushman put the
      woman to shame, while she stood dumb or stammering. The M&#259;luka had
      touched the one chord in the man&rsquo;s heart that was not strained to
      breaking point, and instantly the fingers closed over the sovereigns, and
      the defiant hand fell to his side, as with a husky &ldquo;Not from your
      sort, boss,&rdquo; he turned sharply on his heel; and as he walked away a
      hand was brushed hastily across the weary eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that brushing of the hand the inevitable reaction began, and for a
      little while we feared we would have another sick traveller on our hand.
      But only for a little while. After a day or two of rest and care his
      strength came back, but his thoughts were ever of those seven years of
      steadfast comradeship. Simply and earnestly he spoke of them and of that
      mother, all unconscious of the heartbreak that was speeding only too
      surely to her. Poor mother! And yet those other two nameless graves on
      that little rise deep in the heart of the bush bear witness that other
      mothers have even deeper sorrows to bear. Their sons are gone from them,
      and they, knowing nothing of it, wait patiently through the long silent
      years for the word that can never come to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few days the man rested, and then, just when work&mdash;hard work&mdash;was
      the one thing needful, Dan came in for a consultation, and with him a
      traveller, the bearer of a message from our kind, great-hearted chief to
      say that work was waiting for the mate at the line party. Our chief was
      the personification of all that is best in the bush-folk (as all bushmen
      will testify to his memory)&mdash;men&rsquo;s lives crossed his by chance
      just here and there, but at those crossing places life have been happier
      and better. For one long weary day the mate&rsquo;s life had run parallel
      with our chief&rsquo;s, and because of that, when he left us his heart was
      lighter than ever we had dared to hope for. But this man was not to fade
      quite out of our lives, for deep in that loyal heart the M&#259;luka had
      been enshrined as &ldquo;one in ten thousand.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The bearer of the chief&rsquo;s message had also carried out all extra
      mail for us, and, opening it, we found the usual questions of the South
      folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever do you do with your time?&rdquo; they all asked. &ldquo;The
      monotony would kill me,&rdquo; some declared. &ldquo;Every day must seem
      the same,&rdquo; said others: every one agreeing that life out-bush was
      stagnation, and all marvelling that we did not die of ennui.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever do you do with your time?&rdquo; The day Neaves&rsquo;s
      mate left was devoted to housekeeping duties&mdash;&ldquo;spring-cleaning,&rdquo;
      the M&#259;luka called it, while Dan drew vivid word-pictures of dogs
      cleaning their own chains. The day after that was filled in with
      preparations for a walk-about, and the next again found us camped at
      Bitter Springs. Monotony! when of the thirty days that followed these
      three every day was alike only in being different from any other,
      excepting in their almost unvarying menu: beef and damper and tea for a
      first course, and tea and damper and jam for a second. They also resembled
      each other, and all other days out-bush, in the necessity of dressing in a
      camp mosquito net. &ldquo;Stagnation!&rdquo; they called it, when no day
      was long enough for its work, and almost every night found us camped a day&rsquo;s
      journey from our breakfast camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was August, well on in the Dry, and on a cattle station in the
      Never-Never &ldquo;things hum&rdquo; in August. All the surface waters are
      drying up by then, and the outside cattle&mdash;those scattered away
      beyond the borders&mdash;are obliged to come in to the permanent waters,
      and must be gathered in and branded before the showers scatter them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were altogether at the Springs: Dan, the Dandy, the Quiet Stockman,
      ourselves, every horse-&ldquo;boy&rdquo; that could be mustered, a
      numerous staff of camp &ldquo;boys&rdquo; for the Dandy&rsquo;s work, and
      an almost complete complement of dogs, Little Tiddle&rsquo;ums only being
      absent, detained at the homestead this time with the cares of a nursery. A
      goodly company all told as we sat among the camp fires, with our horses
      clanking through the timber in their hobbles: forty horses and more, pack
      teams and relays for the whole company and riding hacks, in addition to
      both stock and camp horses for active mustering; for it requires over two
      hundred horses to get through successfully a year&rsquo;s work on a
      &ldquo;little place like the Elsey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of the company had his special work to attend to; but every one&rsquo;s
      work was concerned with cattle, and cattle only. The musterers were to
      work every area of country again and again, and the Dandy&rsquo;s work
      began in the building of the much-needed yard to the north-west.
    </p>
    <p>
      We breakfasted at the Springs all together, had dinner miles apart, and
      all met again at the Stirling for supper. Dan and ourselves dined also at
      the Stirling on damper and &ldquo;push&rdquo; and vile-smelling blue-black
      tea. The damper had been carried in company with some beef and tea, in Dan&rsquo;s
      saddle-pouch; the tea was made with the thick, muddy, almost putrid water
      of the fast-drying water hole, and the &ldquo;push&rdquo; was provided by
      force of circumstances, the pack teams being miles away with the plates,
      knives, and forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out-bush we take the good with the bad as we find it; so we sat among
      towering white-ant hills, drinking as little of the tea as possible and
      enjoying the damper and &ldquo;push&rdquo; with hungry relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the Stirling are acres of red-coloured, queer-shaped uncanny white
      ant hills, and camped among these we sat, each served with a slice of
      damper that carried a smaller slice of beef upon it, providing the &ldquo;push&rdquo;
      by cutting off small pieces of the beef with a pen-knife, and &ldquo;pushing&rdquo;
      them along the damper to the edge of the slice, to be bitten off from
      there in hearty mouthfuls.
    </p>
    <p>
      No butter, of course. In Darwin, eight months before we had tasted our
      last butter on ship-board, for tinned butter, out-bush, in the tropics, is
      as palatable as castor oil. The tea had been made in the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      quart-pot, our cups having been carried dangling from our saddles, in the
      approved manner of the bush-folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We breakfasted at the Springs, surrounded by the soft forest beauty; ate
      our dinner in the midst of grotesque ant-hill scenery, and spent the
      afternoon looking for a lost water-hole.

    <p>
      The Dandy was to build his yard at this hole when it was found, but the
      difficulty was to find it. The Sanguine Scot had &ldquo;dropped on it
      once,&rdquo; by chance, but lost his bearing later on. All we knew was
      that it was there to be found somewhere in that corner of the run&mdash;a
      deep permanent hole, &ldquo;back in the scrub somewhere,&rdquo; according
      to the directions of the Sanguine Scot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the black boys could have found it; but it is the habit of black
      boys to be quite ignorant of the whereabouts of all lost or unknown
      waters, for when a black fellow is &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; he is looked for
      at water, and in his wisdom keeps any &ldquo;water&rdquo; he can a secret
      from the white folk, an unknown &ldquo;water&rdquo; making a safe
      hiding-place when it suits a black fellow to obliterate himself for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually we found our hole, after long wanderings and futile excursions
      up gullies and by-ways, riding always in single file, with the men in
      front to break down a track through scrub and grass, and the missus behind
      on old Roper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a cow&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; Dan said, mentally reviewing the
      order of the procession, as, after dismounting, we walked round our find&mdash;a
      wide-spreading sheet of deep, clay&mdash;coloured water, snugly hidden
      behind scrubby banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we clambered on, two bushmen all in white, a dog or two, and a woman in
      a holland riding-dress, the M&#259;luka pointed out the inaptness of the
      simile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cow&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is wanting in expression
      and takes no interest in its owner&rsquo;s hopes and fears,&rdquo; and
      suggested a dog&rsquo;s tail as a more happy comparison. &ldquo;Has she
      not wagged along behind her owner all afternoon?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;drooping
      in sympathy whenever his hopes came to nothing; stiffening expectantly at
      other times, and is even now vibrating with pleasure in this his hour of
      triumph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bush-folk being old fashioned, no one raised any objection to the term
      &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; as Dan chuckled over the amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thinking the matter well out, Dan decided he was &ldquo;what you
      might call a tail-less tyke.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to manage
      without any wagging, haven&rsquo;t we, Brown, old chap?&rdquo; he said,
      unconscious of the note in his voice that told of lonely years and vague
      longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Brown acknowledged this reference to himself, by stirring the circle of
      hairs that expressed his sentiments to the world, Dan further proved the
      expansiveness of the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s simile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have noticed,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that when a dog
      does own a tail he generally manages to keep it out of the fight somehow.&rdquo;
      (In marriage as Dan had known it, strong men had stood between their women
      and the sharp cuffs and blows of life; &ldquo;keeping her out of the fight
      somehow.&rdquo;) Then the procession preparing to re-form, as the M&#259;luka,
      catching Roper, mounted me again, Dan completely rounded off the simile.
      &ldquo;Dogs seem able to wrestle through somehow without a tail,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but I reckon a tail &rsquo;ud have a bit of a job getting
      along without a dog.&rdquo; As usual, Dan&rsquo;s whimsical fancy had
      burrowed deep into the heart of a great truth; for, in spite of what
      &ldquo;tails&rdquo; may say, how few there are of us who have any desire
      to &ldquo;get along without the dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the water-hole about five o&rsquo;clock, and riding into the
      Stirling camp at sundown, found the Dandy there, busy at the fire, with a
      dozen or so of large silver fish spread out on green leaves beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; Dan cried at the first sight of them, and the
      Dandy explained that the boys had caught &ldquo;shoals of &rsquo;em&rdquo;
      at his dinner-camp at the Fish Hole, assuring us that the water there was
      &ldquo;stiff with &rsquo;em.&rdquo; But the Dandy had been busy elsewhere.
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; Dan had said at the sight of the fish, and
      pointing to a billy full of clear, sweet water that was just thinking of
      boiling, the M&#259;luka echoed the sentiment if not the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dug a soakage along the creek a bit and got it,&rdquo; the Dandy
      explained; and as we blessed him for his thoughtfulness, he lifted up a
      clean cloth and displayed a pile of crisp Johnny cakes. &ldquo;Real slap
      up ones,&rdquo; he assured us, breaking open one of the crisp, spongy
      rolls. It was always a treat to be in camp with the Dandy: everything
      about the man was so crisp and clean and wholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we settled down to supper, the Fizzer came shouting through the
      ant-hills, and, soon after, the Quiet Stockman rode into camp. Our Fizzer
      was always the Fizzer. &ldquo;Managed to escape without help?&rdquo; he
      shouted in welcome as he came to the camp fire, alluding to his promise
      &ldquo;to do a rescue&rdquo;; and then he surveyed our supper. &ldquo;Struck
      it lucky, as usual,&rdquo; he declared, helping himself to a couple of
      fish from the fire and breaking open one of the crisp Johnny cakes.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t beat grilled fish and hot rolls by much, to say nothin&rsquo;
      of tea.&rdquo; The Fizzer was one of those happy, natural people who
      always find the supply exactly suited to the demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if our Fizzer was just our Fizzer, the Quiet Stockman was changing
      every day. He was still the Quiet Stockman, and always would be, speaking
      only when he had something to say, but he was learning that he had much to
      say that was worth saying, or, rather, much that others found worth
      listening to; and that knowledge was squaring his shoulders and bringing a
      new ring into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the camp fires we touched on any subject that suggested itself, but
      at the Stirling that night, four of us being Scotch, we found Scotland and
      Scotchmen an inexhaustible topic, and before we turned in were all of Jack&rsquo;s
      opinion, that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t beat the Scots.&rdquo; Even the Dandy
      and the Fizzer were converted; and Jack having realised that there are
      such things as Scotchwomen&mdash;Scotch-hearted women&mdash;a new bond was
      established between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had much sleep that night, and before dawn there was no doubt left
      in our mind about the outside cattle coming in. It seemed as though every
      beast on the run must have come in to the Stirling that night for a drink.
      Every water-hole out-bush is as the axis of a great circle, cattle pads
      narrowing into it like the spokes of a wheel, from every point of the
      compass, and along these pads around the Stirling mob after mob of cattle
      came in in single file, treading carelessly, until each old bull leader,
      scenting the camp, gave its low, deep, drawn-out warning call that told of
      danger at hand. After that rang out, only an occasional snapping twig
      betrayed the presence of the cattle as they crept cautiously in for the
      drink that must be procured at all hazards. But after the drink the only
      point to be considered was safety, and in a crashing stampede they rushed
      out into the timber. Till long after midnight they were at it, and as
      Brown and I were convinced that every mob was coming straight over our
      net, we spent an uneasy night. To make matters worse, just as the camp was
      settling down to a deep sleep after the cattle had finally subsided, Dan&rsquo;s
      camp reveille rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was barely three o&rsquo;clock, and the Fizzer raised an indignant
      protest of: &ldquo;Moonrise, you bally ass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; Dan persisted, unfortunately bent on argument;
      &ldquo;not at this quarter of the moon, and besides it was moonlight all
      evening,&rdquo; and, that being a strong peg to hang his argument on,
      investigating heads appeared from various nets. &ldquo;Seem to think I don&rsquo;t
      know dawn when I see it,&rdquo; Dan added, full of scorn for the camp&rsquo;s
      want of observation; but before we had time to wither before his scorn,
      Jack turned the tables for us with his usual quiet finality. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the west you&rsquo;re looking at,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s
      just set&rdquo;; and the curtain of Dan&rsquo;s net dropped instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you he was a bally ass,&rdquo; the Fizzer shouted in his
      delight, and promising Dan something later on, he lay down to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan, however, was hopelessly roused. &ldquo;Never did that before,&rdquo;
      gurgled out of his net, just as we were dropping off once more; but a
      withering request from the Dandy to &ldquo;gather experience somewhere
      else,&rdquo; silenced him till dawn, when he had the wisdom to rise
      without further reveille.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast we all separated again: the Dandy to his yard-building at
      the Yellow Hole, and the rest of us, with the cattle boys, in various
      directions, to see where the cattle were, each party with its team of
      horses, and carrying in its packs a bluey, an oilskin, a mosquito net, a
      plate, knife, and fork apiece, as well as a &ldquo;change of duds&rdquo;
      and a bite of tucker for all: the bite of tucker to be replenished with a
      killer when necessary, the change of duds to be washed by the boys also
      when necessary, and the plate to serve for all courses, the fastidious
      turning it over for the damper and jam course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka spent one day with Dan beyond the &ldquo;frontgate&rdquo;&mdash;his
      tail wagging along behind as a matter of course&mdash;another day passed
      boundary-riding, inspecting water-holes, and doubling back to the Dandy&rsquo;s
      camp to see his plans; then, picking up the Quiet Stockman, we struck out
      across country, riding four abreast through the open forest-lands, and
      were camped at sundown, in the thick of the cattle, miles from the Dandy&rsquo;s
      camp, and thirty miles due north from the homestead. &ldquo;Whatever do
      you do with your time?&rdquo; asked the South folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan was in high spirits: cattle were coming in everywhere, and another
      beautiful permanent &ldquo;water&rdquo; had been discovered in unsuspected
      ambush. To know all the waters of a run is important; for they take the
      part of fences, keeping the cattle in certain localities; and as cattle
      must stay within a day&rsquo;s journey or so of water, an unknown water is
      apt to upset a man&rsquo;s calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the honour of finding the hole was all Dan&rsquo;s, it was named DS. in
      his honour, and we had waited beside it while he cut his initials deep
      into the trunk of a tree, deploring the rustiness of his education as he
      carved. The upright stroke of the D was simplicity itself, but after that
      complications arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always got me dodged which way to turn the darned thing,&rdquo;
      Dan said, scratching faint lines both ways, and standing off to decide the
      question. We advised turning to the right, and the D was satisfactorily
      completed, but S proved the &ldquo;dead finish,&rdquo; and had to be
      wrestled with separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see why they don&rsquo;t name a chap with something
      that&rsquo;s easily wrote,&rdquo; Dan said, as we rode forward, with our
      united team of horses and boys swinging along behind us, and M and T and O
      were quoted as examples. &ldquo;Reading&rsquo;s always had me dodged,&rdquo;
      he explained. &ldquo;Left school before I had time to get it down and
      wrestle with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like reading and writing,&rdquo; the Quiet
      Stockman broke in, with an earnestness that was almost startling; and as
      he sat that evening in the firelight poring over the &ldquo;Cardinal&rsquo;s
      Snuff-box,&rdquo; I watched him with a new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s reading was very puzzling. He always had the same book&mdash;that
      &ldquo;Cardinal&rsquo;s Snuff-box&rdquo;&mdash;and pored over it with a
      strange persistence, that could not have been inspired by the book. There
      was no expression on his face of lively interest or pleasure, just an
      intent, dogged persistence; the strong, firm chin set as though he were
      colt-breaking. Gradually, as I watched him that night, the truth dawned on
      me: the man was trying to teach himself to read. The &ldquo;Cardinal&rsquo;s
      Snuff-box&rdquo;! and the only clue to the mystery, a fair knowledge of
      the alphabet learned away in a childish past. In truth, it takes a deal to
      &ldquo;beat the Scots,&rdquo; or, what is even better, to make them feel
      that they are beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I watched, full of admiration, for the proud, strong character of the
      man, he looked up suddenly, and, in a flash, knew that I knew. Flushing
      hotly, he rose, and &ldquo;thought he would turn in&rdquo;; and Dan, who
      had been discussing education most of the evening, decided to &ldquo;bottle
      off a bit of sleep too for next day&rsquo;s use,&rdquo; and opened up his
      swag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about not being too good at the reading
      trick,&rdquo; he said, surveying his permanent property: &ldquo;a chap
      doesn&rsquo;t need to carry books round with him to put in the spare time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka laughed. He was lying on his back,
      with an open book face downwards on his chest, looking up at the stars. He
      always had a book with him, but, book-lover as he was, it rarely got
      farther than his chest when we were in camp. Life out-bush is more
      absorbing than books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course reading&rsquo;s handy enough for them as don&rsquo;t lay
      much stock on education,&rdquo; Dan owned, stringing his net between his
      mosquito-pegs, then, struck with a new idea, he &ldquo;wondered why the
      missus never carries books round. Any one &rsquo;ud think she wasn&rsquo;t
      much at the reading trick herself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never see you at
      it, missus, when I&rsquo;m round.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay too much stock on education,&rdquo; I answered, and, chuckling,
      Dan retired into his net, little guessing that when he was &ldquo;round,&rdquo;
      his own self, his quaint outlook on life, and the underlying truth of his
      inexhaustible, whimsical philosophy, were infinitely more interesting than
      the best book ever written.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Quiet Stockman seemed perplexed at the answer. &ldquo;I thought
      reading &rsquo;ud learn you most things,&rdquo; he said, hesitating beside
      his own net; and before we could speak, the corner of Dan&rsquo;s net was
      lifted and his head reappeared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a deal of things
      in my time,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;but&nbsp;<i>reading&nbsp;</i>never
      taught me none of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; Then his head once more disappeared,
      and we tried to explain matters to the Quiet Stockman. The time was not
      yet ready for the offer of a helping hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four in the morning we were roused by a new camp reveille of
      Star-light. &ldquo;Nothing like getting off early when mustering&rsquo;s
      the game,&rdquo; Dan announced. By sun-up the musterers were away, and by
      sundown we were coming in to Bitter Springs, driving a splendid mob of
      cattle before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka and I had had nothing to do with the actual gathering in
      of the mob, for the missus had not &ldquo;shaped&rdquo; too well at her
      first muster and preferred travelling with the pack teams when active
      mustering was in hand. Ignominious perhaps, but safe, and safety counts
      for something in this world; anyway, for the poor craven souls. Riding is
      one thing; but crashing through timber and undergrowth, dodging
      overhanging branches, leaping fallen logs, and stumbling and plunging over
      crab-holed and rat-burrowed areas, to say nothing of charging bulls
      turning up at unexpected corners, is quite another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not cut out for the job,&rdquo; was Dan&rsquo;s verdict, and the M&#259;luka
      covered my retreat by saying that he had more than enough to do without
      taking part in the rounding up of cattle. Had mustering been one of a
      manager&rsquo;s duties, I&rsquo;m afraid the house would have &ldquo;come
      in handy&rdquo; to pack the dog away in with its chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the yard of the Springs came into view, we were making plans for the
      morrow, and admiring the fine mattress swinging before us on the tails of
      the cattle; but there were cattle buyers at the Springs who upset all our
      plans, and left no time for the bang-tailing of the mob in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buyers were Chinese drovers, authorised by their Chinese masters to
      buy a mob of bullocks. &ldquo;Want big mob,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Cash!
      Got money here,&rdquo; producing a signed cheque ready for filling in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Chinese buyer always pays &ldquo;cash&rdquo; for a mob&mdash;by cheque&mdash;generally
      taking care to withdraw all cash from the bank before the cheque can be
      presented, and, as a result, a dishonoured cheque is returned to the
      station, reaching the seller some six or eight weeks after the sale. Six
      or eight weeks more then pass in demanding explanations, and six or eight
      more obtaining them, and after that just as many more as Chinese slimness
      can arrange for before a settlement is finally made. &ldquo;Cash,&rdquo;
      the drover repeated insinuatingly at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s unfathomable
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Then, certain that he was inspired, added, &ldquo;Spot
      Cash!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the M&#259;luka had decided on a plan of campaign and, echoing
      the drover&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spot Cash,&rdquo; began negotiations for a sale;
      and within ten minutes the drovers retired to their camp, bound to take
      the mob when delivered, and inwardly marvelling at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      simple trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan was appalled at it; but, always deferential where the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      business insight was concerned, only &ldquo;hoped he knew that them chaps
      needed a bit of watching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their cash does,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka corrected, to Dan&rsquo;s
      huge delight; and, leaving the musterers to go on with their branding
      work, culling each mob of its prime bullocks as they mustered, he set
      about finding some one to &ldquo;watch the cash,&rdquo; and four days
      later rode into the Katherine Settlement, with Brown and the missus, as
      usual, at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had spent one week out-bush, visiting the four points of the compass,
      half a day at the homestead packing a fresh swag; three days riding into
      the Katherine, having found incidental entertainment on the road, and on
      the fourth day were entering into an argument by wire with Chinese
      slimness. &ldquo;The monotony would kill me,&rdquo; declared the
      townsfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road in we had met the Village Settlement homeward bound&mdash;the
      bonnie baby still riding on its mother&rsquo;s knee, and smiling out of
      the depths of its sunbonnet; but every one else was longing for the bush.
      Darwin had proved all unsatisfying bustle and fluster, and the trackless
      sea, a wonder that inspired strange sickness when travelled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For four days the M&#259;luka argued with Chinese slimness before he felt
      satisfied that his cash was in safe keeping while the Wag and others did
      as they wished with our spare time. Then, four days later, again Cheon and
      Tiddle&rsquo;ums were hailing us in welcome at the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their joy was short-lived, for as soon as the homestead affairs had
      been seen to, and a fresh swag packed, we started out-bush again to look
      for Dan and his bullocks, and, coming on their tracks at our first night
      camp, by following them up next morning we rode into the Dandy&rsquo;s
      camp at the Yellow Hole well after midday, to find ourselves surrounded by
      the stir and bustle of a cattle camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever do you do with your time?&rdquo; ask the townsfolk, sure
      that life out-bush is stagnation, but forgetting that life is life
      wherever it may be lived.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter18" id="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Only three weeks before, as we hunted for it through scrub and bush and
      creek-bed, the Yellow Hole had been one of our Unknown Waters, tucked
      snugly away in an out-of-the-way elbow of creek country, and now we found
      it transformed into the life-giving heart of a bustling world of men and
      cattle and commerce. Beside it stood the simple camp of the stockman&mdash;a
      litter of pack-bags, mosquito-nets, and swags; here and there were
      scattered the even more simple camps of the black boys; and in the
      background, the cumbrous camp of the Chinese drovers reared itself up in
      strong contrast to the camps of the bushfolk&mdash;two fully equipped
      tents for the drovers themselves and a simpler one for their black boys.
      West of the Yellow Hole boys were tailing a fine mob of bullocks, and to
      the east other &ldquo;boys&rdquo; were &ldquo;holding&rdquo; a rumbling
      mob of mixed cattle, and while Jack and Dan rode here and there shouting
      orders for the &ldquo;cutting out&rdquo; of the cattle, the Dandy busied
      himself at the fire, making tea as a refresher, before getting going in
      earnest, the only restful, placid, unoccupied beings in the whole camp
      being the Chinese drovers. Not made of the stuff that &ldquo;lends a hand&rdquo;
      in other people&rsquo;s affairs, they sat in the shade of their tents and
      looked on, well pleased that men should bustle for their advantage. As we
      rode past the drovers they favoured us with a sweet smile of welcome,
      while Dan met us with a chuckle of delight at the sweetness of their
      smile, and as Jack took our horses&mdash;amused both at the drovers&rsquo;
      sweetness and Dan&rsquo;s appreciation of it&mdash;the Dandy greeted us
      with the news that we had &ldquo;struck it lucky, as usual,&rdquo; and
      that a cup of tea would be ready in &ldquo;half a shake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan also considered we had &ldquo;struck it lucky,&rdquo; but from a
      different point of view, for he had only just come into camp with the
      mixed cattle, and as the bullocks among them more than completed the
      number required, he suggested the drovers should take delivery at once,
      assuring us, as we drank the tea, that he was just about dead sick of them
      &ldquo;little Chinese darlings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;little Chinese darlings,&rdquo; inwardly delighted that the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      simple trust seemed as guileless as ever, smugly professed themselves
      willing to fall in with any arrangement that was pleasing to the white
      folk, and as they mounted their horses Dan heaved a sigh of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan&rsquo;s satisfaction was premature, for it took time and much
      galloping before the &ldquo;little Chinese darlings&rdquo; could satisfy
      themselves and each other that they had the very finest bullocks
      procurable in their mob. A hundred times they changed their minds:
      rejecting chosen bullocks, recalling rejected bullocks, and comparing
      every bullock accepted with every bullock rejected. Bulk was what they
      searched for&mdash;plenty for their money, as they judged it, and finally
      gathered together a mob of coarse, wide-horned, great-framed beasts,
      rolling in fat that would drip off on the road as they travelled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d got &rsquo;em together for a
      boiling-down establishment, with a bone factory for a side line,&rdquo;
      Dan chuckled, secretly pleased that our best bullocks were left on the
      run, and, disbanding the rejected bullocks before &ldquo;they&rdquo; could
      &ldquo;change their minds again,&rdquo; he gathered together the mixed
      cattle and shut them in the Dandy&rsquo;s new yard, to keep them in hand
      for later branding.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;little Chinese darlings&rdquo; had counted on the use of
      that yard for themselves, and finding that their bullocks would have to be
      &ldquo;watched&rdquo; on camp that night, they stolidly refused to take
      delivery before morning, pointing out that should the cattle stampede
      during the night, the loss would be ours, not theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; Dan chuckled, but the M&#259;luka
      cared little whether the papers were signed then or at sun-up; and the
      drovers, pleased with getting their way so easily, magnanimously offered
      to take charge of the first &ldquo;watch&rdquo;&mdash;the evening watch&mdash;provided
      that only our horses should be used, and that Big Jack and Jackeroo and
      others should lend a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan wouldn&rsquo;t hear of refusing the offer. &ldquo;Bit of exercise&rsquo;ll
      do &rsquo;em good,&rdquo; he said; and deciding the bullocks would be safe
      enough with Jack and Jackeroo, we white folk stretched ourselves in the
      warm firelight after supper, and, resting, watched the shadowy mob beyond
      the camp, listening to the shoutings and gallopings of the watchers as we
      chatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a white man watches cattle, if he knows his business he quiets his
      mob down and then opens them out gradually, to give them room to lie down,
      or ruminate standing without rubbing shoulders with a restless neighbour,
      which leaves him little to do beyond riding round occasionally, to keep
      his &ldquo;boys&rdquo; at their posts, and himself alert and ready for
      emergencies. But a Chinaman&rsquo;s idea of watching cattle is to wedge
      them into a solid body, and hold them huddled together like a mob of
      frightened sheep, riding incessantly round them and forcing back every
      beast that looks as though it might extricate itself from the tangle, and
      galloping after any that do escape with screams of anxiety and impotency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beck! beck!&rdquo; (back), screamed our drovers, as they galloped
      after escaped beasts, flopping and wobbling and gurgling in their saddles
      like half-filled water-bags; galloping invariably after the beasts, and
      thereby inciting them to further galloping. And &ldquo;Beck! beck!&rdquo;
      shouted our boys on duty with perfect mimicry of tone and yells of delight
      at the impotency of the drovers, galloping always <i>outside</i> the
      runaways and bending them back into the mob, flopping and wobbling and
      gurgling in <i>their</i> saddles until, in the half light, it was
      difficult to tell drover from &ldquo;boy.&rdquo; Not detecting the
      mimicry, the drovers in no way resented it; the more the boys screamed and
      galloped in their service the better pleased they were; while the &ldquo;boys&rdquo;
      were more than satisfied with their part of the entertainment, Jackeroo
      and Big Jack particularly enjoying themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em stampeding yet,&rdquo; Dan said at
      last growing uneasy, as more and more cattle escaped, and the mob shifted
      ground with a rumbling rattle of hoofs every few minutes. Finally, as the
      rumbling rattle threatened to become permanent, a long drawn-out cry of
      &ldquo;Ring&mdash;ing&rdquo; from Big Jack sent Dan and the Quiet Stockman
      to their saddles. In ten minutes the hubbub had ceased, Dan&rsquo;s
      master-hand having soothed the irritated beasts; then having opened them
      out he returned to the camp fire alone. Jack had gone on duty before his
      time and sent the &ldquo;little Chinese darlings&rdquo; to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Dan&rsquo;s cattle-tussle reminded him of other tussles with
      ringing cattle; then the cattle-camp suggesting other cattle-camp yarns,
      he settled down to reminiscences until he had us all cold thrills and
      skin-creeps, although we were gathered around a blazing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tale after tale he told of stampedes and of weaners piling up against
      fences. Then followed a tale or two of cattle lying quiet as mice one
      minute, and up on their feet crashing over camps the next, then tales of
      men being &ldquo;treed&rdquo; or &ldquo;skied,&rdquo; and tales of
      scrub-bulls, maddened cow-mothers, and &ldquo;pokers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pokers,&rdquo; it appears, have a habit of poking out of mobs,
      grazing quietly as they edge off until &ldquo;they&rsquo;re gone before
      you miss &rsquo;em.&rdquo; Camps seem to have some special attraction for
      pokers, but we learned they object to interference. Poke round peaceful as
      cats until &ldquo;you rile them,&rdquo; Dan told us, and then glided into
      a tale of how a poker &ldquo;had us all treed once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poked in a bit too close for our fancy while we were at supper,&rdquo;
      he explained, &ldquo;so we slung sticks at him to turn him back to the
      mob, and the next minute was making for trees, but as there was only
      saplings handy, it would have been a bit awkward for the heavy weights if
      there hadn&rsquo;t have been enough of us to divide his attentions up a
      bit.&rdquo; (Dan was a good six feet, and well set up at that.) &ldquo;Climbing
      saplings to get away from a stag isn&rsquo;t much of a game,&rdquo; he
      added, with a reminiscent chuckle; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re too good at the
      bending trick. The farther up the sapling you climb, the nearer you get to
      the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he favoured us with one of his word-pictures: &ldquo;There was the
      sapling bending like a weeping willow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there
      was the stag underneath it, looking up at me and asking if he could do
      anything for me, taking a poke at me boot now and then, just to show
      nothing would be no bother, and there was me, hanging on to the sapling,
      and leaning lovingly over him, telling him not to go hanging round, tiring
      himself out on my account; and there was the other chaps&mdash;all light
      weights&mdash;laughing fit to split, safe in their saplings. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
      as funny as it looked, though,&rdquo; he assured us, finding us
      unsympathetic, &ldquo;and nobody was exactly sorry when one of the lads on
      duty came along to hear the fun, and stock-whipped the old poker back to
      the mob.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka and the Dandy soon proved it was nothing to be &ldquo;treed.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Happens every time a beast&rsquo;s hauled out of a bog, from all
      accounts, that being the only thanks you get for hauling &rsquo;em out of
      the mess.&rdquo; Then Dan varied the recital with an account of a chap
      getting skied once who forgot to choose a tree before beginning the
      hauling business, and immediately after froze us into horror again with
      the details of two chaps &ldquo;lying against an old rotten log with a mob
      of a thousand going over &rsquo;em&rdquo;; and we were not surprised to
      hear that when they felt well enough to sit up they hadn&rsquo;t enough
      arithmetic left between &rsquo;em to count their bruises.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an evening of ghost stories, a creaking door is enough to set teeth
      chattering; and after an evening of cattle-yarns, told in a cattle camp, a
      snapping twig is enough to set hair lifting; and just as the most fitting
      place for ghost stories is an old ruined castle, full of eerie noises, so
      there is no place more suited to cattle-camp yarns than a cattle camp.
      They need the reality of the camp-fire, the litter of camp baggage, the
      rumbling mob of shadowy cattle near at hand, and the possibilities of the
      near future&mdash;possibilities brought home by the sight of tethered
      horses standing saddled and bridled ready &ldquo;in case of accidents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fit surroundings add intensity to all tales, just as it added intensity to
      my feelings when Dan advised the M&#259;luka to swing our net near a
      low-branched tree, pointing out that it would &ldquo;come in handy for the
      missus if she needed it in a hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I favoured climbing the tree at once, and spending the night in it, but
      the men-folk assuring me that I would be &ldquo;bound to hear them coming,&rdquo;
      I turned in, sure only of one thing, that death may come to the bush-folk
      in any form but ennui. Yet so adaptable are we bush-folk to circumstances
      that most of that night was oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sun-up, the drovers, still sweetly smiling, announced that two bullocks
      had strayed during some one&rsquo;s watch. Not in theirs, they hastened to
      assure us, when Dan sniffed scornfully in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan&rsquo;s scorn turned to blazing wrath, when&mdash;the drovers
      refusing to replace the &ldquo;strays&rdquo; with cows from the mixed
      cattle in hand, and refusing also to take delivery of the bullocks, two
      beasts short&mdash;the musterers had to turn out to gather in a fresh mob
      of cattle for the sake of two bullocks. &ldquo;Just as I was settling down
      to celebrate Sunday, too,&rdquo; Dan growled, as he and Jack rode out of
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty years out-bush had not been enough to stamp generations of
      Sabbath-keeping out of Dan&rsquo;s blood, although he was not particular
      which day of the week was set apart for his Sabbath. &ldquo;Two in a
      fortnight&rdquo; was all he worried about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune favouring the musterers, by midday all was peace and order; the
      drovers, placid and contented, had retired to their tents once more,
      reprieved from taking delivery for another day and night, and after
      dinner, as the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; tailed the bullocks and mixed cattle on
      the outskirts of the camp, to graze them, we settled down to &ldquo;celebrate
      our Sabbath&rdquo; by resting in the warm, dry shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there upon the grassy incline that stretched between the camp and
      the Yellow Hole, we settled down each according to his taste; Dan with his
      back against a tree trunk and far-reaching legs spread out before him; the
      M&#259;luka, Jack, and the Dandy flat upon their backs, with bent-back
      folded arms for pillows, and hats drawn over eyes to shade them from the
      too dazzling sunlight; dogs, relaxed and spread out, as near to their
      master as permitted, and the missus &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; in an
      opened-out, bent-back grassy tussock, which had thus been formed into a
      luxurious armchair. At the foot of the incline lay the Yellow Hole,
      gleaming and glancing in the sunshine; all around and about us were the
      bush creatures, rustling in the scrub and grasses&mdash;flies were
      conspicuous by their absence, here and there shafts of sunlight lay across
      the gray-brown shade; in the distance the grazing cattle moved among the
      timber; away out in the glorious sunshine, beyond and above the tree-tops,
      brown-winged, slender Bromli kites wheeled and circled and hovered and
      swooped; and lounging in the sun-flecked shade, well satisfied with our
      lot, we looked out into the blue, sunny depths, each one of us the
      embodiment of lazy contentment, and agreeing with Dan that &ldquo;Sunday
      wasn&rsquo;t a bad institution for them as had no objection to doing a
      loaf now and then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That suggesting an appropriate topic of conversation to Dan, for a little
      while we spoke of the Sabbath-keeping of our Scottish forefathers; as we
      spoke, idly watching the circling, wheeling Bromli kites, that seemed then
      as at all times, an essential part of the sunshine. To the bush-folk of
      the Never-Never, sunshine without Bromli kites would be as a summer&rsquo;s
      day without the sun. All day and every day they hover throughout it, as
      they search and wait and watch for carrion, throwing dim, gliding shadows
      as they wheel and circle, or flashing sunshine from brown wings by quick,
      sudden swoops, hovering and swooping throughout the sunshine, or rising to
      melt into blue depths of the heavens, where other arching, floating specks
      tell of myriads there, ready to swoop, and fall and gather and feast
      wherever their lowest ranks drop earthwards with the crows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazily we watched the floating movement, and as we watched, conversation
      became spasmodic&mdash;not worth the energy required to sustain it&mdash;until
      gradually we slipped into one of those sociable silences of the bushfolk&mdash;silences
      that draw away all active thought from the mind, leaving it a sensitive
      plate ready to absorb impressions and thoughts as they flit about it,
      silences where every one is so in harmony with his comrades and
      surroundings that the breaking of them rarely jars&mdash;spoken words so
      often defining the half-absorbed thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly conscious of each other, of the grazing cattle the Bromli kites, the
      sweet scents and rustling sounds of the bush, of each other&rsquo;s
      thoughts and that the last spoken thought among us had been
      Sabbath-keeping, we rested, idly,&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>thinking, until Dan&rsquo;s
      voice crept into the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was much at religion meself,&rdquo; he said, lazily altering
      his position, &ldquo;but Mrs. Bob was the one to make you see things right
      off.&rdquo; Lazily and without stirring we gave our awakened attention,
      and after a quiet pause the droning Scotch voice went on, too contented to
      raise itself above a drone: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t exactly remember how she
      put it; seemed as though you&rsquo;d only got to hoe your own row the best
      you can, and lend others a hand with theirs, and just let God see after
      the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly, as the droning voice died away, we slipped back into our silence,
      lazily dreaming on, with Dan&rsquo;s words lingering in our minds, until,
      in a little while, it seemed as though the dancing tree-tops, the circling
      Bromli kites, every rustling sound and movement about us, had taken them
      up and were shouting them to the echo. &ldquo;How much you will be able to
      teach the poor, dark souls of the stockmen,&rdquo; a well-meaning
      Southerner had said, with self-righteous arrogance; and in the brilliant
      glory of that bush Sabbath, one of the &ldquo;poor, dark souls&rdquo; had
      set the air vibrating with the grandest, noblest principles of
      Christianity summed up into one brief sentence resonant with its ringing
      commands:<i> Hoe your own row the best you can. Lend others a hand with
      theirs. Let God see to the rest</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men there are in plenty out-bush, &ldquo;not much at religion,&rdquo; as
      they and the world judge it, who have solved the great problem of &ldquo;hoeing
      their own rows&rdquo; by the simple process of leaving them to give others
      a hand with theirs; men loving their neighbours as themselves, and with
      whom God does the rest, as of old. &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am
      God,&rdquo; is still whispered out of the heart of Nature, and those
      bushmen, unconsciously obeying, as unconsciously belong to that great
      simple-hearted band of worshippers, the Quakers; men who, in the hoeing of
      their own rows have ever lived their lives in the ungrudging giving of a
      helping hand to all in need, content that God will see to the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the most scrupulous Quaker could find no fault with the &ldquo;Divine
      Meeting&rdquo; that God was holding that day: the long, restful
      preparation of silence; that emptying of all active thought from the mind;
      that droning Scotch voice, so perfectly tuned to our mood, delivering its
      message in a language that could pierce to the depths of a bushman&rsquo;s
      heart; and then silence again&mdash;a silence now vibrating with thought.
      As gradually and naturally as it had crept upon us, that silence slipped
      away, and we spoke of the multitude of sounds and creatures about us,
      until, seeing deeper and deeper into Dan&rsquo;s message every moment, we
      learned that each sound and creature was hoeing its own row as it alone
      knew how, and, in the hoeing, was lending all others a hand with theirs,
      as they toiled in the Mighty Row of the Universe, each obedient to the
      great law of the Creator that all else shall be left to Him, as through
      them He taught the world that no man liveth to himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find that a woman alone in a camp of men is decidedly out
      of place,&rdquo; the Darwin ladies had said; and yet that day, as at all
      times, the woman felt strangely and sweetly in place in the bushmen&rsquo;s
      camp. &ldquo;A God-forsaken country,&rdquo; others of the town have called
      the Never-Never, because the works of men have not yet penetrated into it.
      Let them look from their own dark alleys and hideous midnights into some
      or all of the cattle camps out-bush, or, better still, right into the
      &ldquo;poor dark souls&rdquo; of the bush-folk themselves&mdash;if their
      vision is clear enough&mdash;before they judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before our midnight had come, the camp was sleeping a deep, sound
      sleep&mdash;those who were not on watch&mdash;a dreamless sleep, for the
      bullocks were peaceful and ruminating, the Chinese drovers having been
      &ldquo;excused&rdquo; from duty lest other beasts should stray during
      &ldquo;some one&rsquo;s&rdquo; watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after sun-up the head drover formally accepted the mob, and, still
      inwardly marvelling at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s trust, filled in his
      cheque, and, blandly smiling, watched while the M&#259;luka made out
      receipts and cancelled the agreement. Then, to show that <i>he</i> dealt
      little in simple trust, he carried the receipts and agreement in private
      and in turn, to Dan, and Jack, and the Dandy, asking each if all were
      honestly made out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan looked at the papers critically (&ldquo;might have been holding them
      upside down for all I knew,&rdquo; he said later), and assured the drover
      that all was right. &ldquo;Which was true&rdquo; he added also later,
      &ldquo;seeing the boss made &rsquo;em out.&rdquo; Dan dealt largely in
      simple trust where the boss was concerned. Jack, having heard Dan&rsquo;s
      report, took his cue from it and passed the papers as &ldquo;just the
      thing&rdquo;; but the Dandy read out every word in them in a loud, clear
      voice, to his own amusement and the drovers&rsquo; discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers having been thus proved satisfactory, the drovers started their
      boys with the bullocks, before giving their attention to the packing up of
      their camp baggage, and we turned to our own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Dandy&rsquo;s new yard was not furnished yet with a draughting lane
      and branding pens, the mixed cattle were to be taken to the Bitter Springs
      yard; and by the time Jack had been seen off with them and our own camp
      packed up, the drovers had become so involved in baggage that Dan and the
      Dandy felt obliged to offer assistance. Finally every one was ready to
      mount, and then we and the drovers exchanged polite farewells and parted,
      seller and buyer each confident that he knew more about the cash for that
      cheque than the other. No doubt the day came when those drovers ceased to
      marvel at the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s simple trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drovers rode away to the north-west, and as we set out to the
      south-east, Dan turned his back on &ldquo;them little darlings&rdquo; with
      a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Reckon that money&rsquo;s been earned, anyway,&rdquo;
      he said. Then, as Jackeroo was the only available &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; the
      others all being on before with the cattle, we gathered together our
      immense team of horses and drove them out of camp. In open order we jogged
      along across country, with Jackeroo riding ahead as pilot, followed by the
      jangling, straggling team of pack-and loose horses, while behind the team
      rode the white folk all abreast, with six or eight dogs trotting along
      behind again. For a couple of hours we jogged along in the tracks of Jack&rsquo;s
      cattle, without coming up with them, then, just as we sighted the great
      rumbling mob, a smaller mob appeared on our right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run &rsquo;em into the mob,&rdquo; Dan shouted; and at his shout
      every man and horse leapt forward&mdash;pack-horses and all&mdash;and went
      after them in pell-mell disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scrub bulls! Keep behind them!&rdquo; Dan yelled giving directions
      as we stampeded at his heels (it is not all advantage for musterers to
      ride with the pack-team) then as we and they galloped straight for Jack&rsquo;s
      mob every one yelled in warning: &ldquo;Hi! look out there! Bulls! Look
      out,&rdquo; until Dan&rsquo;s revolver rang out above the din.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack turned at the shot and saw the bulls, but too late. Right through his
      mob they galloped, splitting it up into fragments, and in a moment
      pack-horses, cattle, riders, bulls, were part of a surging, galloping mass&mdash;boys
      galloping after bulls, and bulls after boys, and the white folk after
      anything and everything, peppering bulls with revolver-shots (stock-whip
      having no effect), shouting orders, and striving their utmost to hold the
      mob; pack and loose horses galloping and kicking as they freed themselves
      from the hubbub; and the missus scurrying here and there on the outskirts
      of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, dodging behind bushes and scrub in her anxiety
      to avoid both bulls and revolver-shots. Ennui forsooth! Never was a woman
      farther from death by ennui.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the horses gathered themselves together in the friendly shelter of
      some scrub, and as the woman sought safety among them, the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      rifle rang out, and a charging bull went down before it. Then out of the
      thick of the uproar Sambo came full gallop, with a bull at his horse&rsquo;s
      heels, and Dan full gallop behind the bull, bringing his rifle to his
      shoulder as he galloped, and as all three galloped madly on Dan fired, and
      the bull pitching blindly forward, Sambo wheeled, and he and Dan galloped
      back to the mob to meet another charging outlaw and deal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in quick succession from all sides of the mob bulls darted out with
      riders at&nbsp;<i>their&nbsp;</i>heels, or riders shot forward with bulls
      at their heels, until the mob looked like a great spoked wheel revolving
      on its own axis. Bull after bull went down before the rifles, old Roper,
      with the M&#259;luka riding him, standing like a rock under fire; and
      then, just as the mob was quieting down, a wild scrub cow with a
      half-grown calf at her heels shot out of the mob and headed straight for
      the pack team, Dan galloping beside her and cracking thunderclaps out of a
      stock-whip. Flash and I scuttled to shelter, and Dan, bending the cow back
      to the mob, shouted as he passed by, at full gallop: &ldquo;Here you are,
      missus; thought you might like a drop of milk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For another five minutes the mob was &ldquo;held&rdquo; to steady them a
      bit before starting, and then, just as all seemed in order, one of the
      prostrate bulls staggered to its feet&mdash;anything but dead; and as a
      yell went up &ldquo;Look out, boss! look out!&rdquo; Roper sprang forward
      in obedience to the spurs, just too late to miss a sudden, mad lunge from
      the wounded outlaw, and the next moment the bull was down with a few more
      shots in him, and Roper was receiving a tribute that only he could
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that surging mob of cattle beside them, the M&#259;luka and Dan had
      dismounted, and were trying to staunch the flow of blood, while black boys
      gathered round, and Jack and the Dandy, satisfied that the injuries were
      not &ldquo;too serious,&rdquo; were leaning over from their saddles
      congratulating the old horse on having &ldquo;got off so easy.&rdquo; The
      wound fortunately, was in the thigh, and just a clean deep punch for, as
      by a miracle, the bull&rsquo;s horn had missed all tendons and as the old
      campaigner was led away for treatment he disdained even to limp, and was
      well within a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing the time of day with Jack,&rdquo; Dan called the scrimmage;
      as we left the field of battle and looking back we found that already the
      Bromli kites were closing in and sinking and settling earthwards towards
      the crows who were impatiently waiting our departure&mdash;waiting to
      convert the erst raging scrub bulls into white, bleaching bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling quicker than the cattle, we were camped and at dinner at
      &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;another lily-strewn billabong&mdash;when
      the mob came in, the thirsty brutes travelling with down-drooping heads
      and lowing deeply and incessantly. Their direction showing that they would
      pass within a few yards of our camp fire, on their way to the water, as a
      matter of course I stood up, and Dan, with a chuckle, assured me that they
      had &ldquo;something else more important on than chivying the missus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the recollection of that raging mob was too vividly in mind, and the
      cattle beginning to trot at the sight of the water, decided against them,
      and the next moment I was three feet from the ground, among the
      low-spreading branches of a giant Paper-bark. Jackeroo was riding ahead,
      and flashed one swift, sidelong glance after me but as the mob trotted by
      he trotted with them as impassive as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we had by no means done with Jackeroo; for as we sat in camp that
      night at the Springs, with the cattle safe in the yard, shouts of laughter
      from the &ldquo;boys&rsquo;&rdquo; camp attracted our attention, and we
      found Jackeroo the centre-piece of the camp, preparing to repeat some
      performance. For a second or so he stood irresolute; then, clutching
      wildly at an imaginary something that appeared to encumber his feet, with
      a swift, darting run and a scrambling clamber, he was into the midst of a
      sapling; then, our silence attracting attention, the black world collapsed
      in speechless convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the missus climbed a tree, little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      chuckled; and the mimicry of action had been so perfect that we knew it
      could only be that. Every detail was there: the moment of indecision, the
      wild clutch at the habit, the quick, feminine lift of the running feet,
      and the indescribably feminine scrambling climb at the finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that one swift, sidelong glance every movement had been photographed on
      Jackeroo&rsquo;s mind, to be reproduced later on for the entertainment of
      the camp with that perfect mimicry characteristic of the black folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was always so. Just as they had &ldquo;beck-becked&rdquo; and
      bumped in their saddles with the Chinese drovers, so they imitated every
      action that caught their fancy, and almost every human being that crossed
      their path&mdash;riding with feet outspread after meeting one traveller;
      with toes turned in, in imitation of another; flopping, or sitting rigidly
      in their saddles, imitating actions of hand and turns of the head;
      anything to amuse themselves, from riding side-saddle to climbing trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeroo being &ldquo;funny man&rdquo; in the tribe, was first favourite
      in exhibitions; but we could get no further pantomime that night, although
      we heard later from Bett-Bett that &ldquo;How the missus climbed a tree&rdquo;
      had a long run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day passed branding the cattle, and the following as we arrived
      within sight of the homestead, Dan was congratulating the M&#259;luka on
      the &ldquo;missus being without a house,&rdquo; and then he suddenly
      interrupted himself &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blest!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
      we didn&rsquo;t forget all about bangtailing that mob for her mattress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We undoubtedly had, but thirty-three nights, or thereabouts, with the
      warm, bare ground for a bed, had made me indifferent to mattresses, and
      hearing that Dan became most hopeful of &ldquo;getting her properly
      educated&rdquo; yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon greeted us with his usual enthusiasm, and handed the M&#259;luka a
      letter containing a request for a small mob of bullocks within three
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like keeping the ball rolling,&rdquo;, Dan said, also
      waxing enthusiastic, while the South-folk remained convinced that life
      out-bush is stagnation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter19" id="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dan and the Quiet Stockman went out to the north-west immediately, to
      &ldquo;clean up there&rdquo; before getting the bullocks together; but the
      M&#259;luka, settling down to arrears of bookkeeping, with the Dandy at
      his right hand, Cheon once more took the missus under his wing feeding her
      up and scorning her gardening efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of a white woman thinking she could grow water-melons,&rdquo;
      he scoffed, when I planted seeds, having decided on a carpet of luxuriant
      green to fill up the garden beds until the shrubs grew. The M&#259;luka
      advised &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; and the seeds coming up within a few days,
      Cheon, after expressing surprise, prophesied an early death or a fruitless
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Muck, however, took a practical interest in the water-melons, and to
      incite him to water them in our absence, he was made a shareholder in the
      venture. As a natural result, the Staff, the Rejected, and the Shadows
      immediately applied for shares&mdash;pointing out that they too carried
      water to the plants&mdash;and the water-melon beds became the property of
      a Working Liability Company with the missus as Chairman of Directors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows were as numerous as ever, the rejected on the increase, but
      the staff was, fortunately, reduced to three for the time being; or,
      rather, reduced to two, and increased again to three: Judy had been called
      &ldquo;bush&rdquo; on business, and the Macs having got out in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie and Biddie had been obliged to resign and go with
      the waggons, under protest, of course, leaving Rosy and Jimmy&rsquo;s
      Nellie augmented by one of the most persistent of all the shadows&mdash;a
      tiny child lubra, Bett-Bett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of us still considered Bett-Bett one of the shadows but she persisted
      that she was the mainstay of the staff. &ldquo;Me all day dust &rsquo;im
      paper, me round &rsquo;im up goat&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;Me sit down
      all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly excelled in &ldquo;rounding-up goat,&rdquo; riding the old
      Billy like a race-horse; and with Rosy filling the position of housemaid
      to perfection, Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie proving invaluable in her vigorous
      treatment of the rejected and the wood-heap gossip filling in odd times,
      life&mdash;so far as it was dependent on black folk&mdash;was running on
      oiled wheels: the house was clean and orderly, the garden flourished; and
      as the melons grew apace, throwing out secondary leaves in defiance of
      Cheon&rsquo;s prophecies, Billy Muck grew more and more enthusiastic, and,
      usurping the position of Chairman of the Directors, he inspired the
      shareholders with so much zeal that the prophecies were almost fulfilled
      through a surfeit of watering. But Cheon&rsquo;s attitude towards the
      water-melons did not change, although he had begun to look with favour
      upon mail-matter and station books, finding in them a power that could
      keep the M&#259;luka at the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two full weeks after our return from the drovers&rsquo; camp our life
      was exactly as Cheon would have it&mdash;peaceful and regular, with an
      occasional single day &ldquo;out-bush&rdquo;; and when the M&#259;luka in
      his leisure began to fulfil his long-standing promise of a defence around
      my garden, Cheon expressed himself well-pleased with his reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the demands of station books and accumulated mail-matter can be
      satisfied in time, and Dan reporting that he was &ldquo;getting going with
      the bullocks,&rdquo; Cheon found his approval had been premature; for, to
      his dismay, the M&#259;luka abandoned the fence, and began preparations
      for a trip &ldquo;bush.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely the missus was not going?&rdquo;
      he said; and next day we left him at the homestead, a lonely figure,
      seated on an overturned bucket, disconsolate and fearing the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon often favoured an upside-down bucket for a seat. Nothing more
      uncomfortable for a fat man can be imagined, yet Cheon sat on his rickety
      perch, for the most part chuckling and happy. Perhaps, like Mark Tapley,
      he felt it a &ldquo;credit being jolly&rdquo; under such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of contrast, we found Dan and Jack optimistic and happy, with some
      good bullocks in hand, a record branding to report for the fortnight&rsquo;s
      work, and a drover in camp of such a delightful turn of mind that he was
      inclined to look upon every bullock mustered as &ldquo;just the thing.&rdquo;
      He was easily disposed of, and within a week we were back at the
      homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had left Cheon sad and disconsolate, but he met us, filled with fury,
      and holding a sack of something soft in his arms. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      &rsquo;er matter?&rdquo; he spluttered, almost choking with rage. &ldquo;Me
      savey grow cabbage&rdquo;; and he flung the sack at our feet as we stood
      in the homestead thoroughfare staring at him in wonder. &ldquo;Paper
      yabber!&rdquo; he added curtly, passing a letter to the M&#259;luka.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kindly, courteous letter from our Eastern neighbour, who had
      &ldquo;ventured to send a cabbage, remembering the homestead garden did
      not get on too well.&rdquo; (His visits had been in Sam&rsquo;s day).
      &ldquo;How kind!&rdquo; we said, and not understanding Cheon&rsquo;s
      wrath, the M&#259;luka opened the bag, and passed two fine cabbages to him
      after duly admiring them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They acted on Cheon like a red rag on a bull. Flinging them from him, he
      sent them spinning across the stony ground with two furious kicks,
      following them up with further furious kicks as we looked on in speechless
      amazement. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;er matter?&rdquo; he growled, as,
      abandoning the chase with a final lunge, he stalked indignantly back to
      us; and as the unfortunate cabbages turned over and lay still on their
      tattered backs, he began to explain his wrath. Was he not paid to grow
      cabbages, he asked, and where had he failed that we should accept cabbages
      from neighbours? Cabbages for ourselves, but insults for him! Then, the
      comical side of his nature coming to the surface as unexpectedly as his
      wrath, he was overcome with laughter, and clung to a verandah post for
      support, while still speechless, we looked on in consternation, for
      laughing was a serious matter with Cheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, me plenty cross fellow,&rdquo; he gasped at intervals and
      finally led the way to the vegetable garden, where he cut an enormous
      cabbage and carried it to the store to weigh it. The scale turned at
      twelve pounds, and, sure of our ground now, we compared its mighty heart
      to the stout heart of Cheon&mdash;a compliment fully appreciated by his
      Chinese mind; then, having disparaged the tattered results to his
      satisfaction, we went to the house and wrote a letter of thanks to our
      neighbour, giving him so vivid a word-picture of the reception of his
      cabbages that he felt inspired to play a practical joke on Cheon later on.
      One thing is very certain&mdash;everyone enjoyed those cabbages including
      even Cheon and the goats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we had cabbage for dinner that day, and the day following, and
      the next day again, and were just fearing that cabbage was becoming a
      confirmed habit when Dan coming in with reports we all went bush again,
      and the spell was broken. &ldquo;A pity the man from Beyanst wasn&rsquo;t
      about,&rdquo; Dan said when he heard of the daily menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in September when Dan came in, and four weeks slipped away
      with the concerns of cattle and cattle-buyers and cattle-duffers, and as
      we moved hither and thither the water-melons leafed and blossomed and
      fruited to Billy&rsquo;s delight, and Cheon&rsquo;s undisguised amazement
      and the line party, creeping on, crept first into our borders and then
      into camp at the Warlochs, and Happy Dick&rsquo;s visits, dog-fights, and
      cribbage became part of the station routine. Now and then a traveller from
      &ldquo;inside&rdquo; passed out, but as the roads &ldquo;inside&rdquo;
      were rapidly closing in, none came from the Outside going in, and because
      of that there were no extra mails, and towards the end of October we were
      wondering how we were &ldquo;going to get through the days until the
      Fizzer was due again,&rdquo; when Dan and Jack came in unexpectedly for a
      consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run clean out of flour,&rdquo; Dan announced, with a wink and a
      mysterious look towards the black world, as he dismounted at the head of
      the homestead thoroughfare then, after inquiring for the &ldquo;education
      of the missus&rdquo; he added, with further winks and mystery, that it
      only needed a nigger hunt to round off her education properly but it was
      after supper before he found a fitting opportunity to explain his winks
      and mystery. Then, joining us as we lounged in the open starry space
      between the billabong and the house, he chuckled: &ldquo;Yes, it just
      needs a nigger hunt to make her education a credit to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan never joined us in the evenings without an invitation, although he was
      not above putting himself in the way of one. Whenever he felt inclined for
      what he called &ldquo;a pitch with the boss and missus&rdquo; he would
      saunter past at a little distance, apparently bound for the billabong, but
      in reality ready to respond to the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Is that you,
      Dan?&rdquo; although just as ready to saunter on if that invitation was
      not forthcoming&mdash;a happy little arrangement born of that tact and
      delicacy of the bush-folk that never intrudes on another man&rsquo;s
      privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan being just Dan rarely had need to saunter on; and as he settled down
      on the grass in acceptance of this usual form of invitation, he wagged his
      head wisely, declaring &ldquo;she had got on so well with her education
      that it &rsquo;ud be a pity not to finish her off properly.&rdquo; Then
      dropping his bantering tone, he reported a scatter-on among the river
      cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything about it before the &lsquo;boys,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s time some one gave a surprise party down
      the river;&rdquo; and a &ldquo;scatter-on&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;niggers
      in,&rdquo; M&#259;luka readily agreed to a surprise patrol of the river
      country, that being forbidden ground for blacks&rsquo; camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good going unless it&rsquo;s going to be a surprise
      party,&rdquo; Dan reiterated; and when the Quiet Stockman was called
      across from the Quarters, he was told that &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t going
      to be no talking before the boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Further consultations being necessary, Dan feared arousing suspicion, and
      to ensure his surprise party, and to guard against any word of the coming
      patrol being sent out-bush by the station &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; he indulged
      in a little dust-throwing, and there was much talking in public about
      going &ldquo;out to the north-west for the boss to have another look round
      there,&rdquo; and much laying of deep plans in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it was decided that the Quiet Stockman and his &ldquo;boys&rdquo;
      were to patrol the country north from the river while we were to keep to
      the south banks and follow the river down to the boundaries in all its
      windings, each party appointed to camp at the Red Lily lagoons second
      night out, each, of course, on its own side of the river. It being
      necessary for Jack to cross the river beyond the Springs, he left the
      homestead half a day before us&mdash;public gossip reporting that he was
      &ldquo;going beyond the Waterhouse horse mustering,&rdquo; and Dan finding
      dust-throwing highly diverting, shouted after him that he &ldquo;might as
      well bring some fresh relays to the Yellow Hole in a day or two,&rdquo;
      and then giving his attention to the packing of swags and pack-bags,
      &ldquo;reckoned things were just about fixed up for a surprise party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter20" id="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      At our appointed time we left the homestead, taking the north-west track
      for over a mile to continue the dust-throwing; and for the whole length of
      that mile Dan reiterated the &ldquo;advantages of surprise parties,&rdquo;
      and his opinion that &ldquo;things were just about properly fixed up for
      one&rdquo;; and when we left the track abruptly and set off across country
      at right angles to it, Sambo&rsquo;s quick questioning, suspicious glance
      made it very evident that he, for one, had gleaned no inkling of the
      patrol, which naturally filled Dan with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;River to-night, Sambo,&rdquo; he said airily, but after that one
      swift glance Sambo rode after us as stolid as ever&mdash;Sambo was always
      difficult to fathom&mdash;while Dan spent the afternoon congratulating
      himself on the success of his dust-throwing, proving with many
      illustrations that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the hardest thing to spring a
      surprise on niggers. Something seems to tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;re
      coming,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Some chaps put it down to second-sight
      or thought-reading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When we turned in Dan was still chuckling over his cute handling of the
      trip. &ldquo;Bluffed &rsquo;em this time all right,&rdquo; he assured us,
      little guessing that the blacks at the &ldquo;Red Lilies,&rdquo; thirty
      miles away, and other little groups of blacks travelling down the river
      towards the lagoons were conjecturing on the object of the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s
      visit&mdash;&ldquo;something having told them we were coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;something&rdquo; however, was neither second-sight nor
      thought-reading, but a very simple, tangible &ldquo;something.&rdquo;
      Sambo had gone for a stroll from our camp about sundown, and one of Jack&rsquo;s
      boys had gone for a stroll from Jack&rsquo;s camp, and soon afterwards two
      tell-tale telegraphic columns of smoke, worked on some blackfellow
      dot-dash-system, had risen above the timber, and their messages had also
      been duly noted down at the Red Lilies and elsewhere, and acted upon. The
      M&#259;luka was on the river, and when the M&#259;luka was about, it was
      considered wisdom to be off forbidden ground; not that the blacks feared
      the M&#259;luka, but no one cares about vexing the goose that lays the
      golden eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On stations in the Never-Never the blacks are supposed to camp either in
      the homesteads, where no man need go hungry, or right outside the
      boundaries on waters beyond the cattle, travelling in or out as desired,
      on condition that they keep to the main travellers&rsquo; tracks&mdash;blacks
      among the cattle having a scattering effect on the herd, apart from the
      fact that &ldquo;niggers in&rdquo; generally means cattle-killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course no man ever hopes to keep his blacks absolutely obedient to this
      rule; but the judicious giving of an odd bullock at not too rare
      intervals, and always at corroborree times, the more judicious winking at
      cattle killing on the boundaries, where cattle scaring is not all
      disadvantage, and the even more judicious giving of a hint, when a hint is
      necessary, will do much to keep them fairly well in hand, anyway from
      openly harrying and defiant killing, which in humanity is surely all any
      man should ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white man has taken the country from the black fellow, and with it his
      right to travel where he will for pleasure or food, and until he is
      willing to make recompense by granting fair liberty of travel, and a fair
      percentage of cattle or their equivalent in fair payment&mdash;openly and
      fairly giving them, and seeing that no man is unjustly treated or hungry
      within his borders&mdash;cattle killing, and at times even man killing by
      blacks, will not be an offence against the white folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black fellow kills cattle because he is hungry and must be fed with
      food, having been trained in a school that for generations has
      acknowledged &ldquo;catch who catch can&rdquo; among its commandments; and
      until the long arm of the law interfered, white men killed the black
      fellow because they were hungry with a hunger that must be fed with gold,
      having been trained in a school that for generations has acknowledged
      &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo; among its commandments; and yet men
      speak of the &ldquo;superiority&rdquo; of the white race, and, speaking,
      forget to ask who of us would go hungry if the situation were reversed,
      but condemn the black fellow as a vile thief, piously quoting&mdash;now it
      suits them&mdash;from those same commandments, that men &ldquo;must not
      steal,&rdquo; in the same breath referring to the white man&rsquo;s crime
      (when it finds them out) as &ldquo;getting into trouble over some shooting
      affair with blacks.&rdquo; Truly we British-born have reason to brag of
      our &ldquo;inborn sense of justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The M&#259;luka being more than willing to give his fair percentage, a
      judicious hint from him was generally taken quietly and for the time
      discreetly obeyed, and it was a foregone conclusion that our &ldquo;nigger
      hunt&rdquo; would only involve the captured with general discomfiture; but
      the Red Lilies being a stronghold of the tribe, and a favourite
      hiding-place for &ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; emergencies were apt to occur
      &ldquo;down the river,&rdquo; and we rode out of camp with rifles unslung
      and revolvers at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan&rsquo;s sleep had in no wise lessened his faith in the efficiency of
      dust-throwing, and as we set out he &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo; the missus
      would &ldquo;learn a thing or two about surprise parties this trip.&rdquo;
      We all did, but the black fellows gave the instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All morning we rode in single file, following the river through miles of
      deep gorges, crossing here and there stretches of grassy country that ran
      in valleys between gorge and gorge, passing through deep Ti Tree forests
      at times, and now and then clambering over towering limestone ridges that
      blocked the way, with, all the while, the majestic Roper river flowing
      deep and wide and silent on our left, between its water-lily fringed
      margins. It would take a mighty drought to dry up the waters of the
      Territory&mdash;permanent, we call them, sure of our rivers and our rains.
      Almost fifty miles of these deep-flowing waterways fell to our share;
      thirty-five miles of the Roper, twelve in the Long Reach, besides great
      holes scattered here and there along the beds of creeks that are mighty
      rivers in themselves &ldquo;during the Wet.&rdquo; Too much water, if
      anything, was the complaint at the Elsey, for water everywhere meant
      cattle everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over two hours we rode, prying into and probing all sorts of odd nooks
      and crannies before we found any sign of blacks, and then, Roper giving
      the alarm, every one sat to attention. Roper had many ways of amusing
      himself when travelling through bush, but one of his greatest delights was
      nosing out hidden black fellows. At the first scent of &ldquo;nigger&rdquo;
      his ears would prick forward, and if left to himself, he would carry his
      rider into an unsuspected nigger camp, or stand peering into the bushes at
      a discomfited black fellow, who was busy trying to think of some excuse to
      explain his presence and why he had hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roper&rsquo;s ears shot forward and he turned aside towards a clump of
      thick-set bushes, Dan chuckled in expectation, but all Roper found was a
      newly deserted gundi camp, and fresh tracks travelling eastwards&mdash;tracks
      left during the night&mdash;after our arrival at the river, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan surveyed the tracks, and his chuckles died out, and, growing sceptical
      of the success of his surprise party, he followed them for a while in
      silence, Sambo riding behind, outwardly stolid, but no doubt, inwardly
      chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other eastward-going tracks a mile or so farther on made Dan even more
      sceptical, and further tracks again set him harking back to his theory of
      &ldquo;something always telling &rsquo;em somehow,&rdquo; and, losing
      interest in nigger-hunts, he became showman of the Roper river scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down into the depths of gorges he led us, through ferny nooks, and over
      the sandy stretches at the base of the mighty clefts through which the
      river flows; and as we rode, he had us leaning back in our saddles, in
      danger of cricking our necks, to look up at lofty heights above us, until
      a rocky peninsula running right into the river, after we had clambered up
      its sides like squirrels, he led the way across its spiky surfaced summit,
      and soon we were leaning forward over our horses&rsquo; necks in danger of
      taking somersaults into space, as we peered over the sides of a precipice
      at the river away down beneath us. &ldquo;Nothing like variety,&rdquo; Dan
      chuckled; and a few minutes later again we were leaning well back in our
      saddles as the horses picked their way down the far side of the ridge, old
      Roper letting himself down in his most approved style; dropping from ledge
      to ledge as he went, stepping carefully along their length, he would pause
      for a moment on their edges to judge distance, then, gathering his feet
      together, he would sway out and drop a foot or more to the next ledge.
      Riding Roper was never more than sitting in the saddle and leaving all
      else to him. Wherever he went there was safety, both for himself and his
      rider whether galloping between trees or beneath over-hanging branches,
      whether dropping down ridges with the surefootedness of a mountain pony,
      or picking his way across the treacherous &ldquo;springy country.&rdquo;
      No one knew better than he his own limits, and none better understood
      &ldquo;springy country.&rdquo; Carefully he would test suspicious-looking
      turf with a cautious fore-paw, and when all roads proved risky, in his own
      unmistakable language he would advise his rider to dismount and walk over,
      having shown plainly that the dangerous bit was not equal to the combined
      weight of horse and man. When Roper advised, wise men obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gorges and ridges were not all Dan had to show us. Twice in our
      thirty-five miles of the Roper&mdash;about ten miles apart&mdash;wide-spreading
      rocky arches completely span the river a foot or so beneath its surface,
      forming natural crossing-places; for at them the full volume of water
      takes what Dan called a &ldquo;duck-under,&rdquo; leaving only smoothly
      flowing shallow streams, a couple of hundred yards wide, running over the
      rocky bridgeways. The first &ldquo;duck-under&rdquo; occurs in a Ti Tree
      valley, and, marvelling at the wonder of the rippling streamlet so many
      yards wide and so few in length, with that deep, silent river for its
      source and estuary&mdash;we loitered in the pleasant forest glen, until
      Dan, coming on further proofs of a black fellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;second-sight&rdquo;
      along the margins of the duck-under, he turned away in disgust, and as we
      followed him through the great forest he treated us to a lengthy discourse
      on thought-reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Salt Creek, coming into the Roper with its deep, wide estuary,
      interrupted both Dan&rsquo;s lecture and our course, and following along
      the creek to find the crossing we left the river, and before we saw it
      again a mob of &ldquo;brumbies&rdquo; had lured us into a &ldquo;drouth&rdquo;
      that even Dan declared was the &ldquo;dead finish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brumby horses being one of the problems of the run, and the destruction of
      brumby stallions imperative, as the nigger-hunt was apparently off, the
      brumby mob proved too enticing to be passed by, and for an hour and more
      it kept us busy, the M&#259;luka and Dan being equally &ldquo;set on
      getting a stallion or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As galloping after brumbies when there is no trap to run them into is
      about as wise as galloping after a flight of swallows, we followed at a
      distance when they galloped, and stalked them against the wind when they
      drew up to reconnoitre: beautiful, clean-limbed, graceful creatures, with
      long flowing manes and tails floating about them, galloping freely and
      swiftly as they drove the mares before them, or stepping with light,
      dancing tread as they drew up and faced about, with the mares now huddled
      together behind them. Three times they drew up and faced about and each
      time a stallion fell before the rifles, then, becoming more wary, they led
      us farther and farther back, evading the rifles at every halt, until
      finally they galloped out of sight, and beyond all chance of pursuit.
      Then, Dan discovering he had acquired the &ldquo;drouth,&rdquo; advised
      &ldquo;giving it best&rdquo; and making for the Spring Hole in Duck Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could do with a drop of spring water,&rdquo; he said, but Dan&rsquo;s
      luck was out this trip, and the Spring Hole proved a slimy bog &ldquo;alive
      with dead cattle,&rdquo; as he himself phrased it. Three dead beasts lay
      bogged on its margin, and held as in a vice, up to their necks in slime
      and awfulness stood two poor living brutes. They turned piteous terrified
      eyes on us as we rode up, and then Dan and the M&#259;luka firing in
      mercy, the poor heads drooped and fell and the bog with a sickening sigh
      sucked them under.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we watched, horribly fascinated, Dan indulged in a soliloquy&mdash;a
      habit with him when ordinary conversation seemed out of place. &ldquo;
      &lsquo;Awful dry Wet we&rsquo;re having,&rsquo; sez he,&rdquo; he
      murmured, &ldquo; &lsquo;the place is alive with dead cattle.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Fact,&rsquo; sez he, &lsquo;cattle&rsquo;s dying this year that
      never died before.&rsquo; &rdquo; Then remarking that &ldquo;this sort of
      thing&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;exactly a thirst quencher,&rdquo; he
      followed up the creek bank into a forest of cabbage-tree palms&mdash;tall,
      feathery-crested palms everywhere, taller even that the forest trees; but
      never a sign of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then two o&rsquo;clock, and our last drink had been at breakfast&mdash;soon
      after sun-up; and for another hour we pegged wearily on, with that seven
      hours&rsquo; drouth done horses, the beating sun of a Territory October
      overhead, Brown stretched across the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s knees on the
      verge of apoplexy, and Sool&rsquo;em panting wearily on. With the breaking
      of her leg little Tiddle&rsquo;ums had ended her bush days, but as she
      lost in bush craft she gained in excellency as a fence personifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      By three o&rsquo;clock we struck water in the Punch Bowl&mdash;a deep,
      volcanic hole, bottomless, the blacks say, but apparently fed beneath by
      the river; but long before then Dan&rsquo;s chuckle had died out, and
      soliloquies had ceased to amuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sight of the water we revived, and as Brown and Sool&rsquo;em
      lay down and revelled on its margin, Dan &ldquo;took a pull as an
      introduction,&rdquo; and then, after unpacking the team and getting the
      fire going for the billy, he opened out the tucker-bags, having decided on
      a &ldquo;fizz&rdquo; as a &ldquo;good quencher.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like a fizz when you&rsquo;ve got a drouth on,&rdquo; he
      said, mixing soda and cream-of-tartar into a cup of water, and drinking
      deeply. As he drank, the &ldquo;fizz&rdquo; spattered its foam all over
      his face and beard, and after putting down the empty cup with a satisfied
      sigh, he joined us as we sat on the pebbly incline, waiting for the billy
      to boil, and with the tucker-bags dumped down around and about us. &ldquo;Real
      refreshing that!&rdquo; he said, drawing a red handkerchief from his belt
      and mopping his spattered face and beard, adding, as he passed the damp
      handkerchief over his ears and neck with chuckling exaggeration: &ldquo;Tell
      you what! A fizz &rsquo;ud be a great thing if you were short of water.
      You could get a drink and have a good wash-up with the one cupful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the &ldquo;fizz,&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s interest in education revived,
      and after dinner he took up the r&ocirc;le of showman of the Roper scenery
      once more, and had us scrambling over boulders and cliffs along the dry
      bed of the creek that runs back from the Punch Bowl, until, having
      clambered over its left bank into a shady glen, we found ourselves beneath
      the gem of the Roper&mdash;a wide-spreading banyan tree, with its
      propped-up branches turning and twisting in long winding leafy passages
      and balconies, over a feathery grove of young palm trees that had crept
      into its generous shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there the passages and balconies graded one to another&rsquo;s
      level, all being held together by innumerable stays and props, sent down
      from branch to branch, and from branches to the grassy turf beneath; and
      one sweeping limb, coming almost to the ground in a gentle incline before
      twisting away and up again, made ascent so simple that the men-folk sent
      the missus for a &ldquo;stroll in midair,&rdquo; sure that no white woman&rsquo;s
      feet had yet trodden those winding ways. And as she strolled about the
      tree&mdash;not climbed&mdash;hindered only by her holland riding-skirt,
      Brown followed, anxiously but cautiously. Then, the spirit of vandalism
      taking hold of the M&#259;luka, he cut the name of the missus deep into
      the yielding bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some wonderful trees on the Elsey, but not one of them will
      compare with the majesty and grandeur of that old banyan. Away from the
      world it stands beyond those rocky ways and boulders, with its soft shade
      sweeping curves, and feathery undergrowth, making a beautiful world of its
      own. For years upon years it has stood there&mdash;may be for centuries&mdash;sending
      down from its branches those props for its old age, bountiful with its
      shade, and indifferent whether its path-ways be trodden by white feet or
      black.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the heat and &ldquo;drouth&rdquo; we could have loitered in that
      pleasant shade; but we were due at the Red Lilies &ldquo;second night out&rdquo;;
      and it being one of the unwritten laws of a &ldquo;nigger-hunt&rdquo; to
      keep appointments&mdash;&ldquo;the other chaps worrying a bit if you don&rsquo;t
      turn up&rdquo;&mdash;soon after four o&rsquo;clock we were out in the
      blazing heat again, following the river now along its higher flood-bank
      through grassy plains and open forest land.
    </p>
    <p>
      By five o&rsquo;clock Dan was prophesying that &ldquo;it &rsquo;ud take us
      all we knew to do the trick in daylight,&rdquo; but at six o&rsquo;clock,
      when we were still eight miles from the Red Lilies, the M&#259;luka
      settled the question by calling for a camp there and then. &ldquo;The
      missus had had enough,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka decided, and Dan became
      anxious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that drouth that&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; he
      lamented; and although agreeing with the M&#259;luka that Jack would
      survive a few hours&rsquo; anxiety, regretted we had &ldquo;no way of
      letting him know.&rdquo; (We were not aware of the efficiency of smoke
      signalling).
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned back a short distance for better watering for horses, settling
      down for the night at the second &ldquo;duck-under&rdquo;&mdash;McMinn&rsquo;s
      bar&mdash;within sound of the rushing of many waters; for here the river
      comes back to the surface with a mighty roar and swirling currents.
      &ldquo;Knockup camp,&rdquo; Dan christened it in his pleasant way, and
      Sambo became unexpectedly curious. &ldquo;Missus knock up?&rdquo; he
      asked, and the M&#259;luka nodding, Sambo&rsquo;s question was forgotten
      until the next mid-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      By then we had passed the Red Lily lagoons, and ridden across the
      salt-bush plain, and through a deep belt of tall, newly sprung green
      grass, that hugged the river there just then, and having been greeted by
      smug, smiling old black fellows, were saluting Jack across two or three
      hundred feet of water, as we stood among our horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slewed!&rdquo; Jack called in answer, through hollowed hands.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t worry. Heard&mdash;the&mdash;missus&mdash;had&mdash;knocked&mdash;up,&rdquo;
      and Dan leaned against his horse, limp with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard the missus had knocked up?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
      blowed! Talk of surprise parties!&rdquo; and the old black fellows looked
      on enjoying the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black fellow plenty savey,&rdquo; they said loftily, and Dan was
      almost persuaded to a belief in debbel-debbels, until our return to the
      homestead, when Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie divulged the Court secret; then Dan
      ejaculated another &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; with the theory
      of second-sight and thought-reading falling about his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a consultation across the river in long-drawn-out syllables, Jack
      decided on a horse muster for the return trip&mdash;genuine this time&mdash;and
      went on his way, after appointing to meet us at Knock-up camp next
      evening. But our horses refusing to leave the deep green feed, we settled
      down just where we were, beside the river, and formed a curious
      camping-ground for ourselves, a small space hacked out and trampled down,
      out of the dense rank grass that towered above and around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was to be a record trip for discomfort. Dan, on opening out the
      tucker-bags, announced ruefully that our supply of meat had &ldquo;turned
      on us&rdquo;; and as our jam-tin had &ldquo;blown,&rdquo; we feared we
      were reduced to damper only, until the M&#259;luka unearthed a bottle of
      anchovy paste, falsely labelled &ldquo;Chicken and Ham.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s
      wife,&rdquo; Dan called it, after &ldquo;tackling some as a relish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birds were everywhere about the lagoons&mdash;ducks, shags, great geese,
      and pigmy geese, hovering and settling about them in screaming clouds; and
      after dinner, deciding we might as well have a bit of game for supper, we
      walked across the open salt-bush plain to the Big Red Lily. But revolvers
      are hardly the thing for duck shooting, and the soft-nosed bullets of the
      M&#259;luka&rsquo;s rifle reducing an unfortunate duck to a tangled mass
      of blood and feathers we were obliged to accept, willy-nilly, the prospect
      of damper and &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; for supper. But our hopes
      died hard, and we sneaked about the gorgeous lagoons, revolvers in hand,
      for a good hour, &ldquo;larning a thing or two about the lagoons&rdquo;
      from Dan as we sneaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red Lily lagoons lie away from the Roper, on either side of it,
      wide-spreading and shallow&mdash;great sheets of water with tall reeds and
      rushes about them, and glorious in flowering time with their immense
      cup-shaped crimson blossoms clustering on long stalks above great floating
      leaves&mdash;leaves nearly approaching three feet in diameter I think; and
      everywhere about the leaves hover birds and along the margins of the
      lagoons stalk countless waders, cranes, jabiroos, and oftentimes douce
      native companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being so shallow and wide-spreading, the lagoons would dry up early in the
      &ldquo;dry&rdquo; were it not that the blacks are able to refill them at
      will from the river; for here the Roper indulges in a third &ldquo;duck-under,&rdquo;
      so curious that with a few logs and sheets of bark the blacks can block
      the way of its waters and overflow them into the lagoons thereby ensuring
      a plentiful larder to hosts of wild fowl and, incidentally, to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the mystery of this &ldquo;duck-under&rdquo; lies under water, it can
      only be described from hearsay. Here, so the blacks say, a solid wall of
      rock runs out into the river, incomplete, though, and complicated, rising
      and terminating before mid-stream into a large island, which, dividing the
      stream unequally, sends the main body of water swirling away along its
      northern borders, while the lesser current glides quietly around the
      southern side, slipping partly over the submerged wall, and partly through
      a great side-long cleft on its face&mdash;gliding so quietly that the
      cleft can be easily blocked and the wall heightened when the waters are
      needed for the lagoons. Black-fellow gossip also reports that the island
      can be reached by a series of subterranean caves that open into daylight
      away at the Cave Creek, miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting nothing better than one miserable shag by our revolvers, we faced
      damper and &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; about sundown, returning to camp
      through a dense Leichardt pine forest, where we found myriads of bat-like
      creatures, inches long, perhaps a foot, hanging head downwards from almost
      every branch of every tree. &ldquo;Flying foxes,&rdquo; Dan called them,
      and Sambo helped himself to a few, finding &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo;
      unsatisfying; but the white folk &ldquo;drew the line at varmints.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had bandicoot once for me Christmas dinner,&rdquo; Dan informed us,
      making extra tea &ldquo;on account of &lsquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;
      &rdquo; taking a bit of &ldquo;washing down.&rdquo; Then, supper over, the
      problem of watering the horses had to be solved. The margins of the
      lagoons were too boggy for safety, and as the horses, fearing alligators
      apparently, refused the river, we had a great business persuading them to
      drink out of the camp mixing dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was down before we began; and long before we were through with the
      tussle, peculiar shrilling cries caught our attention, and, turning to
      face down stream, we saw a dense cloud approaching&mdash;skimming along
      and above the river: a shrilling, moving cloud, keeping all the while to
      the river, but reaching right across it, and away beyond the tree tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly it came to us and sped on, never ceasing its peculiar cry; and as
      it swept on, and we found it was made up of innumerable flying creatures,
      we remembered Dan&rsquo;s &ldquo;flying foxes.&rdquo; In unbroken
      continuity the cloud swept out of the pine forest, along the river, and
      past us, resembling an elongated kaleidoscope, all dark colours in
      appearance; for as they swept by the shimmering creatures constantly
      changed places&mdash;gliding downwards as they flew, before dipping for a
      drink to rise again with swift, glancing movement, shrilling that peculiar
      cry all the while. Like clouds of drifting fog they swept by, and in such
      myriads that, even after the M&#259;luka began to time them, full fifteen
      minutes passed before they began to straggle out, and twenty before the
      last few stragglers were gone. Then, as we turned up stream to look after
      them, we found that there the dense cloud was rising and fanning out over
      the tree tops. The evening drink accomplished, it was time to think of
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan welcomed the spectacle as an &ldquo;impromptu bit of education. Learnt
      something meself, even,&rdquo; he said with lordly superiority. &ldquo;Been
      out-bush forty years and never struck that before&rdquo;; and later, as we
      returned to camp, he declared it &ldquo;just knocked spots off De
      Rougemont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it had taken so long to persuade the horses that a drink could proceed
      out of a mixing dish, that it was time to turn in by then; and Dan
      proceeded to clear a space for a sleeping ground with a tomahawk. &ldquo;Seems
      no end to education once you start,&rdquo; he chuckled, hacking at a
      stubborn tussock. &ldquo;Reckon no other woman ever learned to make a bed
      with a tomahawk.&rdquo; Then Sambo created a diversion by asking for the
      loan of a revolver before taking a message to the blacks&rsquo; camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big mob bad fellow black fellow sit down longa island,&rdquo; he
      explained; and Dan, whimsical under all circumstances, &ldquo;noticed the
      surprise party wasn&rsquo;t exactly going off without a hitch.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have fixed up better for them if they&rsquo;ve got a
      surprise party of their own up their sleeves,&rdquo; he added ruefully,
      looking round at the dense wall of grass about us; and as he and the M&#259;luka
      swung the two nets not six feet apart, we were all of one mind that
      &ldquo;getting murdered was an experience we could do nicely without.&rdquo;
      Then Sambo returning and swinging his net in the narrow space between the
      two others, set Dan chuckling again. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean to make a
      target of himself,&rdquo; he said; but his chuckle died out when Sambo,
      preparing to curl up in the safest place in the camp, explained his
      presumption tersely by announcing that &ldquo;Monkey sit down longa camp.&rdquo;
      Monkey was a law unto himself, and a very unpleasant law, being a reputed
      murderer several times over, and when he and his followers were about,
      white men saw to their rifles; and as we turned in we also agreed &ldquo;that
      this wasn&rsquo;t exactly the kind of nigger hunt we had set out for.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;It makes a difference when the other chap&rsquo;s doing the
      hunting, Sool&rsquo;em, old girl,&rdquo; Dan added, cautioning her to keep
      her &ldquo;weather eye open,&rdquo; as he saw to his rifle and laid it,
      muzzle outwards, in his net. Then, as we settled down for the night with
      revolvers and rifle at hand, and Brown at the head of our net, he &ldquo;hoped&rdquo;
      the missus would not &ldquo;go getting nightmare, and make things
      unpleasant by shooting round promiscuous like,&rdquo; and having by this
      tucked himself in to his satisfaction, he lay down, &ldquo;reckoning this
      ought to just about finish off her education, if she doesn&rsquo;t get
      finished off herself by niggers before morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A cheerful nightcap; but such was our faith in Sool&rsquo;em and Brown as
      danger signals, that the camp was asleep in a few minutes. Perhaps also
      because nigger alarms were by no means the exception: the bush-folk would
      get little sleep if they lay awake whenever they were camped near doubtful
      company. We sleep wherever we are, for it is easy to grow accustomed even
      to nigger alarms, and beside, the bush-folk know that when a man has clean
      hands and heart he has little to fear from even his &ldquo;bad fellow
      black fellows.&rdquo; But the Red Lilies were beyond our boundaries, and
      Monkey was a notorious exception, and shrill cries approaching the camp at
      dawn brought us all to our elbows, to find only the flying foxes returning
      to the pine forest, fanning inwards this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving the horses another drink, and breakfasting on damper and
      &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; we moved on again, past the glory of the
      lagoons, to further brumby encounters, carrying a water-bag on a
      pack-horse by way of precaution against further &ldquo;drouths.&rdquo; But
      such was the influence of &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; that long before
      mid-day the bag was empty, and Dan was recommending bloater-paste as a
      &ldquo;grand thing for breakfast during the Wet seeing it keeps you dry
      all day long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Further damper and &ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; for dinner, and an
      afternoon of thirst, set us all dreading supper, and about sundown three
      very thirsty, forlorn white folk were standing by the duck-under below
      &ldquo;Knock-up camp,&rdquo; waiting for the Quiet Stockman, and hoping
      against hope that his meat had not &ldquo;turned on him&rdquo;; and when
      he and his &ldquo;boys&rdquo; came jangling down the opposite bank, and
      splashing and plunging over the &ldquo;duck-under&rdquo; below, driving a
      great mob of horses before them we assailed him with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although Jack&rsquo;s meat was &ldquo;chucked out days ago&rdquo; he
      was merciful to us and shouted out: &ldquo;Will a dozen boiled duck do
      instead? Got fourteen at one shot this morning, and boiled &rsquo;em right
      off,&rdquo; he explained as we seized upon his tucker-bags. &ldquo;Kept a
      dozen of &rsquo;em in case of accidents.&rdquo; Besides a shot-gun, Jack
      had much sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen cold boiled duck &ldquo;did&rdquo; very nicely after four meals of
      damper and bloater-paste; and a goodly show they made set out in our
      mixing dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan, gloating over them, offered to &ldquo;do the carving.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      real good at the poultry carving trick, when there&rsquo;s a bird apiece,&rdquo;
      he chuckled, spearing bird after bird with a two-pronged fork, and passing
      round one apiece as we sat expectantly around the mixing dish, all among
      the tucker-bags and camp baggage. And so excellent a sauce is hunger that
      we received and enjoyed our &ldquo;bird apiece&rdquo; unabashed and
      unblushingly&mdash;the men-folk returning for further helpings, and the
      &ldquo;boys&rdquo; managing all that were left.
    </p>
    <p>
      All agreed that &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t beat cold boiled duck by much&rdquo;;
      but in the morning grilled fish was accepted as &ldquo;just the thing for
      breakfast&rdquo;; then finding ourselves face to face with Lot&rsquo;s
      wife, and not too much of that, we beat a hasty retreat to the homestead;
      a further opportune &ldquo;catch&rdquo; of duck giving us heart for
      further brumby encounters and another night&rsquo;s camp out-bush. Then
      the following morning as we rode towards the homestead Dan &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo;
      that from an educational point of view the trip had been a pronounced
      success.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter21" id="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just before mid-day&mdash;five days after we had left the homestead&mdash;we
      rode through the Southern slip rails to find the Dandy at work &ldquo;cleaning
      out a soakage&rdquo; on the brink of the billabong, with Cheon
      enthusiastically encouraging him. The billabong, we heard, had threatened
      to &ldquo;peter out&rdquo; in our absence, and riding across the now dusty
      wind-swept enclosure we realised that November was with us, and that the
      &ldquo;dry&rdquo; was preparing for its final fling&mdash;&ldquo;just
      showing what it could do when it tried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the South-east Trades to back it up it was fighting desperately
      against the steadily advancing North-west monsoon, drying up, as it
      fought, every drop of moisture left from last Wet. There was not a blade
      of green grass within sight of the homestead, and everywhere dust whirled,
      and eddied, and danced, hurled all ways at once in the fight, or gathered
      itself into towering centrifugal columns, to speed hither and thither,
      obedient to the will of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half the heavens seemed part of the Dry, and half part of the Wet: dusty
      blue to the south-east, and dark banks of clouds to the north-west, with a
      fierce beating sun at the zenith. Already the air was oppressive with
      electric disturbances, and Dan, fearing he would not get finished unless
      things were kept humming, went out-bush next morning, and the homestead
      became once more the hub of our universe&mdash;the south-east being
      branded from that centre. Every few days a mob was brought in, and
      branded, and disbanded, hours were spent on the stockyard fence;
      pack-teams were packed, unpacked, and repacked; and every day grew hotter
      and hotter, and every night more and more electric, and as the days went
      by we waited for the Fizzer, hungry for mail-matter, with a six weeks&rsquo;
      hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Fizzer came in he came with his usual lusty shouting, but varied
      his greeting into a triumphant: &ldquo;Broken the record this time,
      missus. Two bags as big as a house and a few et-cet-eras!&rdquo; And
      presently he staggered towards us bent with the weight of a mighty mail.
      But a Fizzer without news would not have been our Fizzer, and as he
      staggered along we learned that Mac was coming out to clear the run of
      brumbies. &ldquo;Be along in no time now,&rdquo; the Fizzer shouted.
      &ldquo;Fallen clean out with bullock-punching. Wouldn&rsquo;t put his
      worst enemy to it. Going to tackle something that&rsquo;ll take a bit of
      jumping round.&rdquo; Then the mail-bags and et-cet-eras came down in
      successive thuds, and no one was better pleased with its detail than our
      Fizzer: fifty letters, sixty-nine papers, dozens of books and magazines,
      and parcels of garden cuttings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last you for the rest of the year by the look of it,&rdquo; the
      Fizzer declared later, finding us at the house walled in with a litter of
      mail-matter. Then he explained his interruption. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
      straight on at once,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;for me horses are none too good
      as it is, and the lads say there&rsquo;s a bit of good grass at the
      nine-mile&rdquo;, and, going out, we watched him set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long!&rdquo; he shouted, as cheerily as ever, as he gathered his
      team together. &ldquo;Half-past eleven four weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the Fizzer&rsquo;s shoulders were setting square, for the last
      trip of the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; was before him&mdash;the trip that perished
      the last mailman&mdash;and his horses were none too good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; we called after him. &ldquo;Early showers!&rdquo;
      and there was a note in our voices brought there by the thought of that
      gaunt figure at the well&mdash;rattling its dicebox as it waited for one
      more round with our Fizzer: a note that brought a bright look into the
      Fizzer&rsquo;s face, as with an answering shout of farewell he rode on
      into the forest. And watching the sturdy figure, and knowing the luck of
      our Fizzer&mdash;that luck that had given him his fearless judgment and
      steadfast, courageous spirit&mdash;we felt his cheery &ldquo;Half-past
      eleven four weeks&rdquo; must be prophetic, in spite of those long dry
      stages, with their beating heat and parching dust eddies&mdash;stages eked
      out now at each end with other stages of &ldquo;bad going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past eleven four weeks,&rdquo; the Fizzer had said; and as we
      returned to our mail-matter, knowing what it meant to our Fizzer, we
      looked anxiously to the northwest, and &ldquo;hoped the showers&rdquo;
      would come before the &ldquo;return trip of the Downs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the fifty letters for the house, the Fizzer had left two
      others at the homestead to be called for&mdash;one being addressed to
      Victoria Downs (over two hundred miles to our west), and the other to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.
      Brown, Esq.,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      Charge of Stud Bulls going West<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Via
      northern territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uninitiated may think that the first was sent out by mistake and that
      the second was too vaguely addressed; but both letters went into the rack
      to await delivery, for our faith in the wisdom of our Postal Department
      was great; it makes no mistakes, and to it&mdash;in a land where everybody
      knows everybody else, and all his business, and where it has taken him&mdash;an
      address could never be too vague. The bush-folk love to say that when it
      opened out its swag in the Territory it found red tape had been forgotten,
      but having a surplus supply of common sense on hand, it decided to use
      that in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it would seem. &ldquo;Down South&rdquo; envelopes are laboriously
      addressed with the names of stations and vias here and vias there; and
      throughout the Territory men move hither and thither by compulsion or
      free-will giving never a thought to an address; while the Department,
      knowing the ways of its people, delivers its letters in spite of, not
      because of, these addresses. It reads only the name of the man that heads
      the address of his letters and sends the letters to where that man happens
      to be. Provided it has been clearly stated which Jones is meant the
      Department will see to the rest, although it is wise to add Northern
      Territory for the guidance of Post Offices &ldquo;Down South.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Jones travelling with cattle for Wave Will,&rdquo; reads the
      Department; and that gossiping friendly wire reporting Jones as &ldquo;just
      leaving the Powell,&rdquo; the letter lies in the Fizzer&rsquo;s loose-bag
      until he runs into Jones&rsquo;s mob; or a mail coming in for Jones,
      Victoria River, when this Jones is on the point of sailing for a trip
      south, <i>his</i> mail is delivered on shipboard; and as the Department
      goes on with its work, letters for east go west, and for west go south&mdash;in
      mail-bags, loose-bags, travellers&rsquo; pockets or per black boy&mdash;each
      one direct to the bush-folk as a migrating bird to its destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, painstaking as our Department is with our mail-matter, it excels
      itself in its handling of telegrams. Southern red tape has decreed&mdash;no
      doubt wisely as far as it goes&mdash;that telegrams shall travel by
      official persons only; but out-bush official persons are few, and apt to
      be on duty elsewhere when important telegrams arrive; and it is then that
      our Department draws largely on that surplus supply of common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always deferential to the South, it obediently pigeon-holes the telegram,
      to await some official person, then, knowing that a delay of weeks will
      probably convert it into so much waste paper, it writes a &ldquo;duplicate,&rdquo;
      and goes outside to send it &ldquo;bush&rdquo; by the first traveller it
      can find. If no traveller is at hand, the &ldquo;Line&rdquo; is &ldquo;called
      up&rdquo; and asked if any one is going in the desired direction from
      elsewhere; if so, the &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; is repeated &ldquo;down the
      line,&rdquo; but if not, a traveller is created in the person of a black
      boy by means of a bribing stick of tobacco. No extra charge, of course.
      Nothing&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;an extra in the Territory. &ldquo;Nothing to
      do with the Department,&rdquo; says the chief; &ldquo;merely the personal
      courtesy of our officers.&rdquo; May it be many a long day before the
      forgotten shipment of red tape finds its way to the Territory to strangle
      the courtesy of our officers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing finds itself outside this courtesy. The Fizzer brings in great
      piles of mail-matter, unweighed and unstamped, with many of the envelopes
      bursting or, at times, in place of an envelope, a request for one; and
      &ldquo;our officers,&rdquo; getting to work with their &ldquo;courtesy,&rdquo;
      soon put all in order, not disdaining even the licking of stamps or the
      patching or renewing of envelopes. Letters and packets are weighed,
      stamped, and repaired&mdash;often readdressed where addresses for South
      are blurred; stamps are supplied for outgoing mail-matter and telegrams;
      postage-dues and duties paid on all incoming letters and parcels&mdash;in
      fact, nothing is left for us to do but to pay expenses incurred when the
      account is rendered at the end of each six months. No doubt our Department
      would also read and write our letters for us if we wished it, as it does,
      at times, for the untutored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever it can, it helps the bush-folk, and they, in turn, doing what
      they can to help it in self-imposed task, are ever ready to &ldquo;find
      room somewhere&rdquo; in pack-bags or swags for mail-matter in need of
      transport assistance&mdash;the general opinion being that &ldquo;a man
      that refuses to carry a man&rsquo;s mail to him &rsquo;ud be mean enough
      to steal bread out of a bird-cage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the knowledge of the bush-folk, only one man had proved &ldquo;mean
      enough.&rdquo; A man who shall be known as the Outsider, for he was one of
      a type who could never be one of the bush-folk, even though he lived
      out-bush for generations: a man so walled in with self and selfishness
      that, look where he would, he could see nothing grander or better than his
      own miserable self, and knowing all a mail means to a bushman, he could
      refuse to carry a neighbour&rsquo;s mail&mdash;even though his road lay
      through that neighbour&rsquo;s run&mdash;because he had had a difference
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stealing bread from a caged bird wasn&rsquo;t in it!&rdquo; the
      homestead agreed, with unspeakable scorn; but the man was so reconciled to
      himself that the scorn passed over him unnoticed. He even missed the
      contempt in the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s cutting &ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo; when
      he hoped we understood him. (The Outsider, by the way, spoke of the
      Never-Never as a land where you can Never-Never get a bally thing you
      want! the Outsider&rsquo;s wants being of the flesh pots of Egypt). It
      goes without saying that the M&#259;luka sent that neighbour&rsquo;s mail
      to him without delay, even though it meant a four-days&rsquo; journey for
      a &ldquo;boy&rdquo; and station horses, for the bush-folk do what they can
      to help each other and the Department in the matter of mails, as in all
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the Outsider always remained the only exception, and within a
      day or two of the Fizzer&rsquo;s visit a traveller passed through going
      east who happened to know that the &ldquo;chap from Victoria Downs was
      just about due at Hodgson going back west,&rdquo; and one letter went
      forward in his pocket en route to its owner. But before the other could be
      claimed Cheon had opened the last eighty-pound chest of tea, and the
      homestead fearing the supply might not be equal to the demands of the Wet,
      the Dandy was dispatched in all haste for an extra loading of stores. And
      all through his absence, as before it, and before the Fizzer&rsquo;s
      visit, Dan and the elements &ldquo;kept things humming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily the soakage yielded less and less water, and daily Billy Muck and
      Cheon scrimmaged over its yield; for Billy&rsquo;s melons were promising
      to pay a liberal dividend, and Cheon&rsquo;s garden was crying aloud for
      water. Every day was filled with flies, and dust, and prickly heat, and
      daily and hourly our hands waved unceasingly, as they beat back the
      multitude of flies that daily and hourly assailed us&mdash;the flies and
      dust treated all alike, but the prickly heat was more chivalrous, and
      refrained from annoying a woman. &ldquo;Her usual luck!&rdquo; the
      men-folk said, utilising verandah-posts or tree-trunks for scratching
      posts when not otherwise engaged. Daily &ldquo;things&rdquo; and the
      elements hummed, and as they hummed Dan and Jack came and went like Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisps&mdash;sometimes
      from the south-east and sometimes from the north-east; and as they came
      and went, the M&#259;luka kept his hand on the helm; Happy Dick filled in
      odd times as he alone knew how; a belated traveller or two passing out
      came in, and went on, or remained; Brown of the Bulls sent on a drover
      ahead of the mob to spy out the land, and the second letter left the rack,
      while all who came in, or went on, or remained, during their stay at the
      homestead, stood about the posts and uprights waving off flies, and
      rubbing and wriggling against the posts like so many Uriah Heeps, as they
      laid plans, gossiped, gave in reports, or &ldquo;swopped yarns.&rdquo; The
      Territory is hardly an earthly paradise just before the showers. Still,
      Cheon did all he could to make things pleasanter, regaling all daily on
      hop-beer, and all who came in were sure of a welcome from him&mdash;Dan
      invariably inspiring him with that ever fresh little joke of his when
      announcing afternoon tea to the quarters. &ldquo;Cognac!&rdquo; he would
      call, and also invariably, Dan made a great show of expectant haste, and a
      corresponding show of disappointment, when the teapot only was
      forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cheon&rsquo;s little joke and the afternoon tea were only interludes
      in the heat and thirst and dust. Daily things hummed faster and faster,
      and the South-east Trades skirmished and fought with the North-west
      monsoon, until the Willy-Willys, towering higher and higher sped across
      the plain incessantly, and whirled, and spun and danced like storm
      witches, in, and out and about the homestead enclosure, leaving its acres
      all dust, and only dust, with the house, lightly festooned in creepers
      now, and set in its deep-green luxuriant garden of melons, as a pleasant
      oasis in a desert of glare and dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily and hourly men waved and perspired and rubbed against scratching
      posts, and daily and hourly the Willy-Willys whirled and spun and danced,
      and daily and hourly as they threatened to dance, and spin, and whirl
      through the house, the homestead sped across the enclosure to slam doors
      and windows in their faces, thus saving our belongings from their
      whirling, dusty ravages; and when nimbler feet were absent it was no
      uncommon sight to see Cheon, perspiring and dishevelled, speeding towards
      the house like a huge humming-top, with speeding Willy-Willys speeding
      after him, each bent on reaching the goal before the other. Oftentimes
      Cheon outraced the Willy-Willys, and a very chuckling, triumphant Cheon
      slammed-to doors and windows, but at other times, the Willy-Willys
      outraced Cheon, and, having soundly buffeted him with dust and debris,
      sped on triumphant in their turn, and then a very wrathful, spluttering,
      dusty Cheon sped after them. Also after a buffeting Cheon was generally
      persuaded an evil spirit dwelt within certain Willy-Willys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is even a limit to keeping things humming during a Territory
      November; and things coming to a climax in a succession of dry
      thunderstorms, two cows died in the yards from exhaustion, and Dan was
      obliged to &ldquo;chuck it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too bad, though,&rdquo; he said, reviewing the years work,
      after fixing up a sleeping camp for the Wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp consisted of a tent-fly, extended verandah-like behind the
      Quarters, open on three sides to the air and furnished completely with a
      movable four-legged wooden bunk: and surveying it with satisfaction, as
      the Willy-Willys danced about it, Dan reckoned it looked pretty
      comfortable. &ldquo;No fear of catching cold, anyway,&rdquo; he said, and
      meant it, having got down to the root of hygiene; for among Dan&rsquo;s
      pet theories was the theory that &ldquo;houses are fine things to catch
      cold in,&rdquo; backing up the theory by adding: &ldquo;Never slept in one
      yet without getting a cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp fixed up, Dan found himself among the unemployed, and, finding
      the M&#259;luka had returned to station books and the building of that
      garden fence, and that Jack had begun anew his horse-breaking with a small
      mob of colts, he envied them their occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing nothing&rsquo;s the hardest job I ever struck,&rdquo; he
      growled, shifting impatiently from shade to shade, and dratting the flies
      and dust; and even sank so low as to envy the missus her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gives her something to do cleaning up after Willy-Willys,&rdquo; he
      growled further, and in desperation took to outracing Willy-Willys&mdash;&ldquo;so
      the missus &rsquo;ull have a bit of time for pitching,&rdquo; and was
      drawn into the wood-heap gossip, until Jack provided a little incidental
      entertainment in the handling of a &ldquo;kicker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack and the missus had found occupation of greater interest than
      horse-breaking, gossiping, or spring cleaning&mdash;an occupation that was
      also affording Dan a certain amount of entertainment, for Jack was &ldquo;wrestling
      with book-learning,&rdquo; which Dan gave us to understand was a very
      different thing from &ldquo;education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still it takes a bit of time to get the whole mob properly broken
      in,&rdquo; he said, giving Jack a preliminary caution. Then, the first
      lesson over, he became interested in the methods of handling the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trick, is it? You just put the yearlings through
      the yard, and then tackle the two-year-olds.&rdquo; he commented, finding
      that after a run through the Alphabet we had settled down to the first
      pages of Bett-Bett&rsquo;s discarded Primer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, having &ldquo;roped all the two-year-olds&rdquo; in that first
      lesson, spent all evening handling them, and the Quarters looked on as he
      tested their tempers, for although most proved willing, yet a few were
      tricky or obstinate. All evening he sat, poring over the tiny Primer, amid
      a buzzing swarm of mosquitoes, with the doggedness all gone from his face,
      and in its place the light of a fair fight, and, to no one&rsquo;s
      surprise, in the morning we heard that &ldquo;all the two-year-olds came
      at his call.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another lesson at the midday spell roped most of the three-year-olds, and
      another evening brought them under the Quiet Stockman&rsquo;s will, and
      then in a few more days the four-year-olds and upwards had been dealt
      with, and the Primer was exhausted.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Got through with the first draught, anyway,&rdquo; Dan commented,
      and, no Second Book being at our service we settled down to Kipling&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Just-So Stories.&rdquo; Then the billabong &ldquo;petering out&rdquo;
      altogether, and the soakage threatening to follow suit, its yield was kept
      strictly for personal needs, and Dan and the M&#259;luka gave their
      attention to the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to happen soon,&rdquo; they declared, as we
      gasped in the stifling calm that had now settled down upon the Territory;
      for gradually the skirmishings had ceased, and the two great giants of the
      Territory element met in the centre of the arena for their last desperate
      struggle. Knee to knee they were standing, marvellously well matched this
      year, each striving his utmost, and yet neither giving nor taking an inch;
      and as they strove their satellites watched breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Willy-Willys had lain down to watch the silent struggle, and Dan,
      finding himself left entirely without occupation, &ldquo;feared he would
      be taking to book-learning soon if something didn&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Never knew the showers so late,&rdquo; he growled; and the
      homestead was inclined to agree that it was the &ldquo;dead-finish&rdquo;;
      but remembering that even then our Fizzer was battling through that last
      stage of the Dry, we were silent, and Dan remembering also, devoted
      himself to the &ldquo;missus,&rdquo; she being also a person of leisure
      now the Willy-Willys were at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours we pitched near the restful green of the melon-beds, and as we
      pitched the M&#259;luka ran fencing wires through two sides of the garden
      fence, while Tiddle&rsquo;ums and Bett-Bett, hovering about him, adapted
      themselves to the new order of things, finding the line the goats had to
      stop at no longer imaginary. And as the fence grew, Dan lent a hand here
      and there, the rejected and the staff indulged in glorious washing-days
      among the lilies of the Reach; Cheon haunted the vegetable patch like a
      disconsolate ghost; while Billy Muck, the rainmaker, hovered bat-like over
      his melons, lending a hand also with the fence when called upon. As Cheon
      mourned, his garden also mourned, but when the melons began to mourn, at
      the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s suggestion, Billy visited the Reach with two
      buckets, and his usual following of dogs, and after a two-mile walk gave
      the melons a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Billy Muck pressed old Jimmy into the service and, the Reach
      being visited twice, the melons received eight buckets of water Then Cheon
      tried every wile he knew to secure four buckets for his garden. &ldquo;Only
      four,&rdquo; he pleaded, lavish in his bribes. But Billy and Jimmy had
      &ldquo;knocked up longa a carry water,&rdquo; and Cheon watched them
      settle down to smoke, on the verge of tears. Then a traveller coming in
      with the news that heavy rain had fallen in Darwin&mdash;news gleaned from
      the gossiping wire&mdash;Cheon was filled with jealous fury at the good
      fortune of Darwin, and taunted Billy with rain-making taunts. &ldquo;If he
      were a rain-maker,&rdquo; he taunted, &ldquo;he would make a little when
      he wanted it, instead of walking miles with buckets,&rdquo; and the taunts
      rankling in Billy&rsquo;s royal soul, he retired to the camp to see about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope he does the trick,&rdquo; the traveller said, busy unpacking
      his team. &ldquo;Could do with a good bath fairly soon.&rdquo; But Dan
      cautioned him to &ldquo;have a care,&rdquo; settling down in the shade to
      watch proceedings. &ldquo;These early showers are a bit tricky,&rdquo; he
      explained, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell how long they&rsquo;ll last. Heard of a
      chap once who reckoned it was good enough for a bath, but by the time he&rsquo;d
      got himself nicely soaped the shower was travelling on ten miles a minute,
      and there wasn&rsquo;t another drop of rain for a fortnight, which wasn&rsquo;t
      too pleasant for the prickly heat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The homestead rubbed its back in sympathy against the nearest upright, and
      Dan added that &ldquo;of course the soap kept the mosquitoes dodged a bit,&rdquo;
      which was something to be thankful for. &ldquo;There generally is
      something to be thankful for, if you only reckon it out,&rdquo; he assured
      all. But the traveller, reduced to a sweltering prickliness by his
      exertions, wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;noticing much at present,&rdquo; as he
      rubbed his back in his misery against the saddle of the horse he was
      unpacking. Then his horse, shifting its position, trod on his foot; and as
      he hopped round, nursing his stinging toes, Dan found an illustration for
      his argument. &ldquo;Some chaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; &rsquo;ud be
      thankful to have toes to be trod on&rdquo;; and ducking to avoid a coming
      missile, he added cheerfully, &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s even an advantage
      about having wooden legs at times. Heard once of a chap that reckoned
      &rsquo;em just the thing. Trod on a death-adder unexpected-like in his
      camp, and when the death-adder whizzed round to strike it, just struck
      wood, and the chap enjoyed his supper as usual that night. That chap had a
      wooden leg,&rdquo; he added, unnecessarily explicit; and then his argument
      being nicely rounded off, he lent a hand with the pack-bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller filled in Dan&rsquo;s evening, and Neaves&rsquo; mate coming
      through next day, gave the Quarters a fresh start and then just before
      that sundown we felt the first breath of victory from the monsoon&mdash;just
      a few cool, gusty puffs of wind, that was all, and we ran out to enjoy
      them, only to scurry back into shelter, for our first shower was with us.
      In pelting fury it rushed upon us out of the northwest, and rushing upon
      us, swept over us and away from us into the south-east, leaping from
      horizon to horizon in the triumph of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, it left a sweltering awfulness behind it, but it
      was a promise of better things; and even as Dan was inquiring with a
      chuckle &ldquo;whether that chap in the Quarters had got a bath out of it,&rdquo;
      a second pelting fury rushed over us, filling Cheon&rsquo;s heart with
      joy, and Billy with importance. Unfortunately it did not fill the
      water-butts with water, but already the garden was holding up its head,
      and Billy was claiming that he had scored a win.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, waylaying Cheon in the garden, &ldquo;Well,
      me rainmaker? Eh?&rdquo; and Cheon&rsquo;s superstitious heart bowed down
      before such evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ten-minutes&rsquo; deluge half an hour later licked up every grain of
      dust, filled the water-butts to overflowing, brought the insect pest to
      life as by magic, left a shallow pool in the heart of the billabong, and
      added considerably to Billy&rsquo;s importance. Had not Brown of the Bulls
      come in during that ten-minutes&rsquo; deluge, Cheon would probably have
      fallen to offering sacrifices to Billy. As it was, he could only load him
      with plum-cake, before turning his attention to the welcoming of Brown of
      the Bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the boss drover&rsquo;s fancy in the way of cooking?&rdquo;
      he inquired of the missus, bent on his usual form of welcome, and the boss
      drover, a great burly Queenslander, with a voice as burly as his frame,
      answered for himself with a laughing &ldquo;Vegetables! and as many as you
      think I&rsquo;ve room for.&rdquo; Then, as Cheon gravely measured his
      inches with his eye, a burly chuckle shook the boss drover&rsquo;s great
      frame as he repeated: &ldquo;Just as many as you think I can hold,&rdquo;
      adding in half apology: &ldquo;been away from women and vegetables for
      fifteen months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; we told him, quoting the man from
      Beyanst, but hopeful to find the woman placed first. Then acting on a hint
      from Cheon, we took him to the banana clump.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening another five-minutes&rsquo; deluge gladdened our
      hearts, as the &ldquo;lavender&rdquo; bugs and other sweet pests of the
      Territory insect pest saddened our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after breakfast-time Happy Dick was across &ldquo;To see how you&rsquo;ve
      fared,&rdquo; he said, and then, to the diversion of Brown of the Bulls,
      Cheon and Happy Dick rejoiced together over the brimming water-butts, and
      mourned because the billabong had not done better, regretting the while
      that the showers were so &ldquo;patchy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then while Happy Dick was assuring us that &ldquo;both Warlochs were
      bankers,&rdquo; the Sanguine Scot rode in through the slip-rails at the
      North track, waving his hat in greeting and with Bertie and Bertie&rsquo;s
      Nellie tailing along behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back again!&rdquo; Mac called, light-hearted as a schoolboy just
      escaped from drudgery, while Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie, as a matter of course,
      was overcome with ecstatic giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mac and the showers with us, we felt there was little left to wish
      for, and told Brown of the Bulls that he might now prepare to enjoy
      himself, and with a chuckle of anticipation Brown &ldquo;hoped&rdquo; the
      entertainment would prove &ldquo;up to samples already met with,&rdquo; as
      he could &ldquo;do with a little enjoyment for a change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter22" id="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie quietly gathered the reins of
      management into her own hands, and as a matter of course, Jimmy&rsquo;s
      Nellie indulged in ear-splitting continuous protest, and Brown of the
      Bulls expressed himself as satisfied, so far, with the entertaining powers
      of the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, we left the servant problem to work out its own
      solution, and, also as a matter of course, the Sanguine Scot was full of
      plans for the future but particularly bubbling over with the news that he
      had secured Tam-o&rsquo;-Shanter for a partner in the brumby venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be along in a few days,&rdquo; he explained, confident
      that he was &ldquo;in luck this time all right,&rdquo; and remembering Tam
      among the horses at the Katherine, we congratulated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, our conversation was all of brumbies, and Mac was
      also convinced that &ldquo;when you reckoned everything up there was a
      good thing in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;ll take a bit of jumping round,&rdquo; he
      agreed. But the Wet was to be devoted to the building of a strong
      holding-yard, a &ldquo;trap,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;wing,&rdquo; so as to be
      able to get going directly the Wet lifted; and knowing the run well, and
      the extent of the brumby mobs on it, Mac then and there set to work to
      calculate the &ldquo;sized mob&rdquo; that could be &ldquo;got together
      after the Wet,&rdquo; listening with interest to the account of our brumby
      encounters out east.
    </p>
    <p>
      But long before we had done with brumbies Cheon was announcing dinner in
      his own peculiar way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Din-ner! Mis-sus! Boss! All about!&rdquo; he chanted, standing in
      the open doorway nearest to us; and as we responded to his call, he held
      the door of the dining-net and glided into the details of his menu:
      &ldquo;Veg-e-table Soooup!&rdquo; he sang: &ldquo;Ro-oast Bee-ef! Pee-es!
      Bee-ens! Too-mar-toos! Mar-row!&rdquo; and listening, we felt Brown of the
      Bulls was being right royally welcomed with as many vegetables as were
      good for him. But the sweets shrank into a simple &ldquo;bakee custard!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what you might call style!&rdquo; Mac and Brown of the
      Bulls declared, as Cheon waved them to seats with the air of an Emperor,
      and for two courses the dinner went forward according to its menu, but at
      the third course tinned peaches had usurped the place of the &ldquo;bakee
      custard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one looked surprised, but, being of the bush-folk, accepted peaches
      and cream without comment, until Cheon, seeing the surprise, and feeling
      an explanation was due&mdash;anyway to the missus&mdash;bent over her and
      whispered in a hoarse aside. &ldquo;Pussy cat been tuck-out custard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the bushmen bent over their plates, intent on peaches and
      cream; but there is a limit to even a bushman&rsquo;s dignity, and with a
      choking gulp Mac exploded, and Brown of the Bulls joining in with a roar
      dragged down the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s self-control; and as Cheon
      reiterated: &ldquo;What name all about laugh, missus,&rdquo; chuckled in
      sympathy himself. Brown of the Bulls pulled himself together for a moment,
      once more to assure us that he was &ldquo;Satisfied so far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day&rsquo;s entertainment was only just beginning for after
      comparing weights and heights, Mac, Jack, Dan and Brown of the Bulls,
      entered into a trial of strength, and a heavy rail having been brought
      down from the stackyard, the &ldquo;caber&rdquo; was tossed before an
      enthusiastic company. The homestead thoroughfare was the arena and around
      it stood or sat the onlookers: the Quarters travellers, Happy Dick, some
      of the Line Party, the M&#259;luka, the missus, and others, and as the
      caber pitched and tossed, Cheon came and went, cheering every throw
      lustily with charming impartiality, beating up a frothy cake mixture the
      while, until, finally, the cakes being in the oven, he was drawn, with
      others, into the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very jaunty, confident Cheon entered the lists, but a very surprised,
      chagrined Cheon retired in high dudgeon. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;er
      matter!&rdquo; he said indignantly. &ldquo;Him too muchee heavy fellow. S&rsquo;pose
      him little fellow me chuck him all right,&rdquo; explaining a comical
      failure with even more comical explanations. Soon after the retirement of
      our crestfallen Cheon, hot cakes were served by a Cheon all rotundity and
      chuckles once more, but immediately afterwards, a snort of indignation
      riveted our attention on an exceedingly bristling, dignified Cheon, who
      was glaring across the enclosure at two of our neighbour&rsquo;s
      black-boys, one of whom was the bearer of a letter, and the other, of a
      long yellow vegetable-marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right up to the house verandah they came, and the letter was presented to
      the M&#259;luka, and the marrow to the missus in the presence of Cheon&rsquo;s
      glare and an intense silence; for most of the bush-folk had heard of the
      cabbage insult. Cheon had seen to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you will wish me luck while enjoying my little gift,&rdquo;
      said the letter, and mistaking its double meaning, I felt really vexed
      with our neighbour, and passing the marrow to Cheon, reflected a little of
      his bristling dignity as I said: &ldquo;This is of no use to any one here,
      Cheon; you had better take it away&rdquo;; and as Cheon accepted it with a
      grateful look, those about the verandah, and those without the garden,
      waited expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was to be no unseemly rage this time. In dignified silence Cheon
      received the marrow&mdash;a sinuous yellow insult, and as the homestead
      waited he raised it above his head, and stalking majestically from us
      towards the finished part of the fence, flung it from him in contemptuous
      scorn, adding a satisfied snort as the marrow, striking the base of a
      fence post, burst asunder, and the next moment, after a flashing swoop, he
      was grovelling under the wires, making frantic efforts to reach a baby
      bottle of whisky that had rolled from within the marrow away beyond the
      fence. &ldquo;Cognac!&rdquo; he gasped, as he struggled, and then, as
      shouts greeted his speedy success, he sat up, adding comically: &ldquo;My
      word! Me close up smash him Cognac.&rdquo; At the thought came his
      inevitable laughter, and as he leant against the fence post, surrounded by
      the shattered marrow, he sat hopelessly gurgling, and choking, and
      shaking, and hugging his bottle, the very picture of a dissolute old
      Bacchanalian. (Cheon would have excelled as a rapid change artist). And as
      Cheon gurgled, and spluttered, and shook, the homestead rocked with yells
      of delight, while Brown of the Bulls rolled and writhed in a canvas
      lounge, gasping between his shouts: &ldquo;Oh, chase him away, somebody;
      cover him up. Where <i>did</i> you catch him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Cheon scrambled to his feet, and, perspiring and exhausted,
      presented the bottle to the M&#259;luka. &ldquo;My word, me cross fellow!&rdquo;
      he said weakly, and then, bubbling over again at the recollection, he
      chuckled: &ldquo;Close up smash him Cognac all right.&rdquo; And at the
      sound of the chuckle Brown of the Bulls broke out afresh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chase him away!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill me
      between you! I never struck such a place! Is it a circus or a Wild West
      Show?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravely the M&#259;luka accepted the bottle, and with the same mock
      gravity answered Brown of the Bulls. &ldquo;It is neither, my man,&rdquo;
      he said; &ldquo;neither a circus, nor a Wild West Show. This is the land
      the poets sing about, the land where dull despair is king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown of the Bulls naturally wished &ldquo;some of the poets were about
      now,&rdquo; and Dan, having joined the house party, found a fitting
      opportunity to air one of his pet grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never <i>done</i> wishing some of them town chaps that
      write bush yarns &rsquo;ud come along and learn a thing or two,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Most of &rsquo;em seem to think that when we&rsquo;re not on
      the drink we&rsquo;re whipping the cat or committing suicide.&rdquo;
      Rarely had Dan any excuse to offer for those &ldquo;town chaps,&rdquo;
      who, without troubling to learn &ldquo;a thing or two,&rdquo; first,
      depict the bush as a pandemonium of drunken orgies, painted women, low
      revenge, remorse, and suicide; but being in a more magnanimous mood than
      usual, as the men-folk flocked towards the Quarters he waited behind to
      add, unconscious of any irony: &ldquo;Of course, seeing it&rsquo;s what
      they&rsquo;re used to in town, you can&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;em to know
      any better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the Quarters &ldquo;Luck to our neighbour&rdquo; was the toast&mdash;&ldquo;luck,&rdquo;
      and the hope that all his ventures might be as successfully carried
      through as his practical joke. After that the M&#259;luka gravely proposed
      &ldquo;Cheon,&rdquo; and Cheon instantly became statuesque and dignified,
      to the further diversion of Brown of the Bulls&mdash;gravely accepting a
      thimbleful for himself, and, as gravely, drinking his own health, the M&#259;luka
      just as gravely &ldquo;clinking glasses&rdquo; with him. And from that day
      to this when Cheon wishes to place the M&#259;luka on a fitting pedestal,
      he ends his long, long tale with a triumphant: &ldquo;Boss bin knock glass
      longa me one time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Dick and Peter filled in time for the Quarters until sundown, when
      Cheon announced supper there with an inspired call of &ldquo;Cognac!&rdquo;
      And then, as if to prove that we are not always on the drink, or &ldquo;whipping
      the cat, or committing suicide,&rdquo; that we can love and live for
      others besides self, Neaves&rsquo; mate came down from the little rise
      beyond the slip-rails, where he had spent his day carving a headstone out
      of a rough slab of wood that now stood at the head of our sick traveller&rsquo;s
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not always on the drink, or whipping the cat, or committing suicide, but
      too often at the Parting of the Ways, for within another twelve hours the
      travellers, Happy Dick, the Line Party, Neaves&rsquo; mate, Brown of the
      Bulls, and Mac, had all gone or were going their ways, leaving us to go
      ours&mdash;Brown back to hold his bulls at the Red Lilies until further
      showers should open up all roads, and Mac to &ldquo;pick up Tam.&rdquo;
      But in the meantime Dan had become Showman of the Showers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; he asked, soon after sun-up, waving his hands
      towards the northern slip-rails, as we stood at the head of the
      thoroughfare speeding our parting guests; and then he drew attention to
      the faintest greenish tinge throughout the homestead enclosure&mdash;such
      a clean-washed-looking enclosure now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be grass soon,&rdquo; he said, and, the sun
      coming out with renewed vigour after another shower, by midday he had
      gathered a handful of tiny blades half an inch in length with a chuckling
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the next midday, grass, inches tall, was rippling all around the
      homestead in the now prevalent northwest breeze, and Dan was preparing for
      a trip out-bush to see where the showers had fallen, and Mac and Tam
      coming in as he went out, Mac greeted us with a jocular: &ldquo;The flats
      get greener every year about the Elsey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; we said, and Mac, overcome with confusion,
      spluttered an apology: &ldquo;Oh, I say! Look here! I didn&rsquo;t mean to
      hit off at the missus, you know!&rdquo; and then catching the twinkle in
      Tam&rsquo;s eyes, stopped short, and with a characteristic shrug &ldquo;reckoned
      he was making a fair mess of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac would never be other than our impetuous brither Scot, distinct from
      all other men, for the bush never robs her children of their
      individuality. In some mysterious way she clean-cuts out the personality
      of each of them, and keeps it sharply clean-cut; and just as Mac stood
      apart from all men, so Tam also stood apart, the quiet self-reliant man,
      though, we had seen among the horses, for that was the real man; and as
      Mac built castles, and made calculations, Tam put his shoulder to the
      drudgery, and before Mac quite knew what had happened, he was hauling logs
      and laying foundations for a brumby trap in the south-east country, while
      Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie found herself obliged to divide her attention
      between the homestead and the brumby camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mac hauled and drudged, the melons paid their first dividend; half-past
      eleven four weeks drew near; &ldquo;Just-So Stories&rdquo; did all they
      could, and Dan coming in found the Quiet Stockman away back in the days of
      old, deep in a simply written volume of Scottish history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan had great news of the showers, but had to find other audience than
      Jack, for he was away in a world all his own, and, bent over the little
      volume, was standing shoulder to shoulder with his Scottish fathers,
      fighting with them for his nation. All evening he followed where they led,
      enduring and suffering, and mourning with them and rejoicing over their
      final victory with a ringing &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat the Scots,&rdquo;
      as the little volume, coming to with a bang, roused the Quarters at
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat the Scots, missus!&rdquo; he repeated, coming
      over in the morning for &ldquo;more of that sort,&rdquo; all unconscious
      how true he was to type, as he stood there, flushed with the victories of
      his forefathers, a strong, young Scot, with a newly conquered world of his
      own at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we hunted for &ldquo;more of that sort,&rdquo; through a medley of odds
      and ends, the Quiet Stockman scanned titles and dipped here and there into
      unknown worlds, and Dan coming by, stared open-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s got the whole mob mouthed and reined
      and schooled in all the paces?&rdquo; he gasped; but Jack put aside the
      word of praise. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s writing and spelling yet,&rdquo; he
      said, and Dan, with his interest in book-learning reviving, watched the
      square chin setting squarer, and was bewildered. &ldquo;Seems to have
      struck a mob of brumbies,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Jack could &ldquo;get properly going&rdquo; with the brumbies,
      two travellers rode into the homestead, supporting between them a third
      rider, a man picked up off the track delirious with fever, and foodless;
      and at the sight of his ghastly face our hearts stood still with fear. But
      the man was one of the Scots&mdash;another Mac&mdash;of the race that
      loves a good fight, and his plucky heart stood by him so well that within
      twenty-four hours he was lying contentedly in the shade of the Quarters,
      looking on, while the homestead shared the Fizzer&rsquo;s welcome with Mac
      and Tam and a traveller or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the south came the Fizzer, lopping once more in his saddle, with
      the year&rsquo;s dry stages behind him, and the set lines all gone from
      his shoulders, shouting as he came: &ldquo;Hullo! What ho! Here&rsquo;s a
      crowd of us!&rdquo; but on his return trip the Fizzer was a man of
      leisure, and we had to wait for news until his camp was fixed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; he shouted, at last joining the company, and Mac
      felt the time was ripe for his jocular greeting and, ogling the Fizzer,
      noticed that &ldquo;The flats get greener every year about the Elsey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Fizzer was a dangerous subject to joke with. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve
      noticed,&rdquo; he shouted as, improving on Mac&rsquo;s ogle, he singled
      him out from the company, then dropping his voice to an insinuating drawl
      he challenged him to have a deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the Sanguine Scot became a Canny Scot, for Mac prided himself on
      a horse-deal. And as no one had yet got the better of the Fizzer the
      company gathered round to enjoy itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A swop,&rdquo; suggested the Fizzer, and Mac agreeing with a
      &ldquo;Right ho!&rdquo; a preliminary hand-shake was exchanged before
      &ldquo;getting to business&rdquo;; and then, as each made a great presence
      of mentally reviewing his team, each eyed the other with the shrewdness of
      a fighting cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brown mare!&rdquo; Mac offered at last, and knowing the staunch
      little beast, the homestead wondered what Mac had up his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explained our suspicions in asides to the travellers, but the Fizzer
      seemed taken by surprise. &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      a stunner! I&rsquo;ve nothing fit to put near her excepting that
      upstanding chestnut down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chestnut was standing near the creek-crossing, and every one knowing
      him well, and sure of that &ldquo;something&rdquo; up Mac&rsquo;s sleeve,
      feared for the Fizzer as Mac&rsquo;s hand came out with a &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;
      and the Fizzer gripped it with a clinching &ldquo;Right ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally we waited for the d&eacute;nouement, and the Fizzer appearing
      unsuspicious and well-pleased with the deal, we turned our attention to
      the Sanguine Scot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac felt the unspoken flattery, and with an introductory cough, and a
      great show of indifference, said: &ldquo;By the way! Perhaps I should have
      mentioned it, but the brown mare&rsquo;s down with the puffs since the
      showers,&rdquo; and looked around the company for approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Fizzer was filling the homestead with shoutings: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      apologise,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing! The chestnut&rsquo;s
      just broken his leg; can&rsquo;t think how he got here. This&rsquo;ll save
      me the trouble of shooting him.&rdquo; Then dropping back to that
      chuckling drawl, and re-assuming the ogle, he added: &ldquo;The&mdash;flats&mdash;get&mdash;greener&mdash;every&mdash;year&mdash;about&mdash;the
      Elsey,&rdquo; and with a good-humoured laugh Mac asked if &ldquo;any other
      gentleman felt on for a swop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, for a while the conversation was all of horse deals, until,
      Happy Dick coming in, it turned as naturally to dog-fights as Peter and
      Brown stalked aggressively about the thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily we hinted to Happy Dick that Peter&rsquo;s welcome was wearing out,
      and daily Happy Dick assured us that he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t keep him
      away nohow.&rdquo; But then Happy Dick&rsquo;s efforts to keep him away
      were peculiar, taking the form of monologues as Peter trotted beside him
      towards the homestead&mdash;reiterations of:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the sort to say nuff, are we, Peter? We&rsquo;ll
      never say die, will we, Peter? We&rsquo;ll win if we don&rsquo;t lose, won&rsquo;t
      we, Peter?&rdquo; Adding, after his arrival at the homestead, a subdued
      &ldquo;S&mdash;s&mdash;ss, go it, Peter!&rdquo; whenever Brown appeared in
      the thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the homestead&rsquo;s hour of triumph was at hand, for as the
      afternoon wore on, Happy Dick found the very best told recital a poor
      substitute for the real thing, and thirsting for a further &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s
      latest,&rdquo; hissed: &ldquo;S&mdash;ss&mdash;s, go it, Peter!&rdquo;
      once too often. For, well, soon afterwards&mdash;figuratively speaking&mdash;Peter
      was carried off the field on a stretcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, Brown had only one sound leg left to stand on, but by propping the
      other three carefully against it, he managed to cut a fairly triumphant
      figure. But Brown&rsquo;s victory was not to be all advantage to the
      homestead, for never again were we to hear &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s latest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t beat the Elsey for a good dog-fight! Can you, Peter?&rdquo;
      the Fizzer chuckled, as Peter lay licking his wounds at Happy Dick&rsquo;s
      feet; but the Quarters, feeling the pleasantry ill-timed, delicately led
      the conversation to cribbage, and at sun-up next morning Happy Dick
      &ldquo;did a get&rdquo; to his work, with bulging pockets, leaving the
      Fizzer packing up and declaring that &ldquo;half a day at the Elsey gave a
      man a fresh start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dan also was packing up&mdash;a &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; brought in by
      the Fizzer having necessitated his presence in Darwin, and as he packed up
      he assured us he would be back in time for the Christmas celebrations,
      even if he had to swim for it but before he left he paid a farewell visit
      to the Christmas dinner. &ldquo;In case of accidents,&rdquo; he explained,
      &ldquo;mightn&rsquo;t see it again. Looks like another case of one apiece,&rdquo;
      he added, surveying with interest the plumpness of six young pullets Cheon
      was cherishing under a coop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have pullet longa Clisymus,&rdquo; Cheon had said, and all
      readily agreeing, &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he had added &ldquo;must have
      really good Clisymus&rdquo;; and another hearty &ldquo;Of course&rdquo;
      convincing him we were at one with him in the matter of Christmas, he
      entered into details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have big poodinn, and almond, and Clisymus cake, and mince
      pie,&rdquo; he chuckled, and then after confiding to us that he had heard
      of the prospective glories of a Christmas dinner at the Pine Creek &ldquo;Pub.,&rdquo;
      the heathen among us urged us to do honour to the Christian festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have top-fellow Clisymus longa Elsey,&rdquo; he said, and even
      more heartily we agreed, &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; giving Cheon <i>carte
      blanche</i> to order everything as he wished us to have it. &ldquo;We were
      there to command,&rdquo; we assured him; and accepting our services, Cheon
      opened the ball by sending the Dandy in to the Katherine on a flying visit
      to do a little shopping, and, pending the Dandy&rsquo;s return we sat down
      and made plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House and the Quarters should join forces that day, Cheon suggested,
      and dine under the eastern verandah &ldquo;No good two-fellow dinner longa
      Clisymus,&rdquo; he said. And the blacks, too, must be regaled in their
      humpy. &ldquo;Must have Vealer longa black fellow Clisymus,&rdquo; Cheon
      ordered, and Jack&rsquo;s services being bespoken for Christmas Eve, to
      &ldquo;round up a Vealer,&rdquo; it was decided to add a haunch of &ldquo;Vealer&rdquo;
      to our menu as a trump card&mdash;Vealers being rarities at Pine Creek.
      Our only regret was that we lived too far from civilisation to secure a
      ham. Pine Creek would certainly have a ham; but we had a Vealer and faith
      in Cheon, and waited expectantly for the Dandy, sure the Elsey would
      &ldquo;come out top-fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as we waited for the Dandy, the Line Party moved on to our northern
      boundary, taking with it possible Christmas guests; the Fizzer came in and
      went on, to face a &ldquo;merry Christmas with damper and beef served in
      style on a pack-bag,&rdquo; also regretting empty mail-bags&mdash;the
      Southern mail having been delayed en route. Tam and the Sanguine Scot
      accepted invitations to the Christmas dinner; and the Wet broke in one
      terrific thunderclap, as the heavens, opening, emptied a deluge over us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that mighty thunderclap the Wet rushed upon us with a roar of falling
      waters, and with them Billy Muck appeared at the house verandah dripping
      like a beaver, to claim further credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;Me rainmaker, eh?&rdquo; and the
      M&#259;luka shouted above the roar and din:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boy for my money, Billy! Keep her going!&rdquo;
      and Billy kept her going to such purpose that by sun-up the billabong was
      a banker, Cheon was moving over the face of the earth with the buoyancy of
      a child&rsquo;s balloon, and Billy had five inches of rain to his credit.
      (So far, eleven inches was the Territory record for one night). Also the
      fringe of birds was back at the billabong, having returned with as little
      warning as it had left, and once more its ceaseless chatter became the
      undertone of the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sun-up Cheon had us in his garden, sure now that Pine Creek could not
      possibly outdo us in vegetables and the Dandy coming in with every
      commission fulfilled we felt ham was a mere detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cheon&rsquo;s cup of happiness was to brim over that day, for after
      answering every question hurled at him, the Dandy sang cheerfully: &ldquo;He
      put in his thumb and pulled out a plum,&rdquo; and dragged forth a ham
      from its hiding-place, with a laughing, &ldquo;What a good boy am I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swoop Cheon was on it, and the Dandy, trying to regain it, said,
      &ldquo;Here, hold hard! I&rsquo;ve to present it to the missus with a bow
      and the compliments of Mine Host.&rdquo; But Cheon would not part with it,
      and so the missus had the bow and the compliments, and Cheon the ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovingly he patted it and asked us if there ever was such a ham? or ever
      such a wonderful man as Mine Host? or ever such a fortunate woman as the
      missus? Had any other woman such a ham or such a friend in need? And
      bubbling over with affection for the whole world, he sent Jackeroo off for
      mistletoe, and presently the ham, all brave in Christmas finery, was
      hanging like a gay wedding-bell in the kitchen doorway. Then the kitchen
      had to be decorated, also in mistletoe, to make a fitting setting for the
      ham, and after that the fiat went forth. No one need expect either eggs or
      cream before &ldquo;Clisymus&rdquo;&mdash;excepting, of course, the sick
      Mac&mdash;he must be kept in condition to do justice to our &ldquo;Clisymus&rdquo;
      fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a week it was&mdash;all festivities, and meagre fare, and whirring
      egg-beaters, and thunderstorms, and downpours, and water-melon dividends,
      and daily visits to the vegetable patch; where Happy Dick was assured,
      during a flying visit, that we were sure of seven varieties of vegetables
      for &ldquo;Clisymus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas for human certainty! Even then swarms of grasshoppers were
      speeding towards us, and by sundown were with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Cheon and the staff, the rejected, Bett-Bett, every shadow and the
      missus, danced war-dances in the vegetable patch, and chivied and chased,
      and flew all ways at once; the grasshoppers had found green stuff exactly
      to their liking, and coming in clouds, settled, and feasted, and flew
      upwards, and settled back, and feasted, and swept on, leaving poor Cheon&rsquo;s
      heart as barren of hope as the garden was of vegetables. Nothing remained
      but pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and Cheon&rsquo;s tardy watermelons, and the
      sight of the glaring blotches of pumpkins filled Cheon with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pumpee-kin for Clisymus!&rdquo; he raved, kicking furiously at the
      hideous wens. Not if he knew it! and going to some stores left in our care
      by the Line Party, he openly stole several tins of preserved vegetables.
      &ldquo;Must have vegetable longa Clisymus,&rdquo; he said, feeling his
      theft amply justified by circumstances, but salved his conscience by
      sending a gift of eggs to the Line Party as a donation towards <i>its</i>
      &ldquo;Clisymus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then finding every one sympathetic, he broached a delicate subject. By
      some freak of chance, he said, the missus was the only person who had
      succeeded in growing good melons this year, and taking her to the melon
      beds, which the grasshoppers had also passed by, he looked longingly at
      three great fruits that lay like mossy green boulders among the rich
      foliage. &ldquo;Just chance,&rdquo; he reiterated, and surely the missus
      would see that chance also favoured our &ldquo;Clisymus.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
      Clisymus without dessert would be no Clisymus at all,&rdquo; he continued,
      pressing each fruit in turn between loving hands until it squeaked in
      response. &ldquo;Him close up ripe, missus. Him sing out!&rdquo; he said,
      translating the squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the missus appeared strangely inattentive, and in desperation Cheon
      humbled himself and apologised handsomely for former scoffings. Not
      chance, he said, but genius! Never was there white woman like the missus!
      &ldquo;Him savey all about,&rdquo; he assured the M&#259;luka. &ldquo;Him
      plenty savey gardin.&rdquo; Further, she was a woman in a thousand! A
      woman all China would bow down to! Worth ninety-one-hundred pounds in any
      Chinese matrimonial market. &ldquo;A valuable asset,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to stand against such flattery. Billy Muck was hastily
      consulted, and out of his generous heart voted two of the mossy boulders
      to the white folk, keeping only one for &ldquo;black fellow all about.&rdquo;
      Poor old Billy! He was to pay dearly for his leaning to the white folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was amiss now but Dan&rsquo;s non-appearance; and the egg-beater
      whirring merrily on, by Christmas Eve, the Dandy and Jack, coming in with
      wild duck for breakfast and the Vealer, found the kitchen full of triumphs
      and Cheon wrestling with an immense pudding. &ldquo;Four dozen egg sit
      down,&rdquo; he chuckled, beating at the mixture. &ldquo;One bottle port
      wine, almond, raisin, all about, more better&rsquo;n Pine Creek all right&rdquo;;
      and the homestead taking a turn at the beating &ldquo;for luck,&rdquo;
      assured him that it &ldquo;knocked spots off Pine Creek.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have money longa poodin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Cheon added, and our
      wealth lying also in a cheque book, it was not until after a careful hunt
      that two threepenny bits were produced, when one, with a hole in it, went
      in &ldquo;for luck,&rdquo; and the other followed as an omen for wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The threepenny bits safely in, it took the united efforts of the homestead
      to get the pudding into a cloth and thence into a boiler, while Cheon
      explained that it would have been larger if only we had had a larger
      boiler to hold it. As it was, it had to be boiled out in the open, away
      from the buildings, where Cheon had constructed an ingenious trench to
      protect the fire from rain and wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four dozen eggs in a pudding necessitates an all-night boiling, and
      because of this we offered to share &ldquo;watches&rdquo; with Cheon, but
      were routed in a body. &ldquo;We were better in bed,&rdquo; he said. What
      would happen to his dinner if any one&rsquo;s appetite failed for want of
      rest? There were too few of us as it was, and, besides, he would have to
      stay up all night in any case, for the mince pies were yet to be made, in
      addition to brownie and another plum-pudding for the &ldquo;boys,&rdquo;
      to say nothing of the hop-beer, which if made too soon would turn with the
      thunder and if made too late would not &ldquo;jump up&rdquo; in time. He
      did not add that he would have trusted no mortal with the care of the
      fires that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did add, however, that it would be as well to dispatch the Vealer over
      night, and that an early move (about fowl-sing-out) would not be amiss;
      and, always obedient to Cheon&rsquo;s will, we all turned in, in good
      time, and becoming drowsy, dreamed of &ldquo;watching&rdquo; great mobs of
      Vealers, with each Vealer endowed with a plum-pudding for a head.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter23" id="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      At earliest dawn we were awakened by wild, despairing shrieks, and were
      instinctively groping for our revolvers when we remembered the fatted
      fowls and Cheon&rsquo;s lonely vigil, and turning out, dressed hastily,
      realising that Christmas had come, and the pullets had sung their last
      &ldquo;sing-out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When we appeared the stars were still dimly shining, but Cheon&rsquo;s
      face was as luminous as a full moon, as, greeting each and all of us with
      a &ldquo;Melly Clisymus,&rdquo; he suggested a task for each and all. Some
      could see about taking the Vealer down from the gallows; six lubras were
      &ldquo;rounded up&rdquo; for the plucking of the pullets, while the rest
      of us were sent out, through wet grass and thicket, into the cold, grey
      dawn, to gather in &ldquo;big, big mob bough and mistletoe,&rdquo; for the
      beautifying of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      How we worked! With Cheon at the helm, every one was of necessity
      enthusiastic. The Vealer was quartered in double-quick time, and the first
      fitful rays of sunlight found their way to the Creek crossing to light up
      an advancing forest of boughs and mistletoe clumps that moved forward on
      nimble black legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a gleaming, rustling procession the forest of green boughs advanced,
      all crimson-flecked with mistletoe and sunlight, and prostrated itself
      around us in mighty heaps at the head of the homestead thoroughfare. Then
      the nimble black legs becoming miraculously endowed with nimble black
      bodies and arms, soon the gleaming boughs were piled high upon the iron
      roof of the Eastern verandah to keep our impromptu dining-hall cool and
      fresh. High above the roof rose the greenery, and over the edge of the
      verandah, throughout its length, hung a deep fringe of green, reaching
      right down to the ground at the posts; everywhere among the boughs trailed
      long strands of bright red mistletoe, while within the leafy bower itself
      hanging four feet deep from the centre of the high roof one dense
      elongated mass of mistletoe swayed gently in the breeze, its heaped-up
      scarlet blossoms clustering about it like a swarm of glorious bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon interrupted the decorations with a call to &ldquo;Bressfass! Duck
      cully and lice,&rdquo; he sang boldly, and then followed in a doubtful,
      hesitating quaver: &ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;sausage. Must have sausage
      for Clisymus bress-fass,&rdquo; he said emphatically, as he ushered us to
      seats, and we agreed with our usual &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; But we found
      fried balls of minced collops, which Cheon hastened to explain <i>would</i>
      have been sausages if only he had had skins to pack them into.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him close up sausage!&rdquo; he assured us, but that anxious quaver
      was back in his voice, and to banish all clouds from his loyal old heart,
      we ate heartily of the collops, declaring they were sausages in all&nbsp;<i>but&nbsp;</i>skins.
      Skins, we persuaded him, were merely appendages to sausages, barriers, in
      fact, between men and delectable feasts; and satisfied that we were
      satisfied, he became all beams once more, and called our attention to the
      curried duck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duck discussed, he hinted that dinner was the be all and end all of
      &ldquo;Clisymus,&rdquo; and, taking the hint, we sent the preparations
      merrily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every chair and stool on the run was mustered; two tables were placed end
      to end beneath that clustering mistletoe and covered with clean white
      tablecloths&mdash;remembering the story of the rags and hobble rings we
      refrained from serviettes&mdash;the hop-beer was set in canvas water bags
      to keep it cool; and Cheon pointing out that the approach from the
      kitchens was not all that could be desired, an enormous tent-fly was
      stretched away from the roof of the verandah, extending it half-way to the
      kitchen, and further greenery was used, decorating it within and without
      to make it a fitting passage-way for the transport of Cheon&rsquo;s
      triumphs. Then Cheon&rsquo;s kitchen decorations were renewed and added
      to; and after that further suggestions suggested and attended to.
      Everything that could be done was done, and by eight o&rsquo;clock all was
      ready for Cheon&rsquo;s triumphs, all but our appetites and time of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nine o&rsquo;clock Mac and Tam had arrived, and after everything had
      been sufficiently admired, we trooped in a body to the kitchen, obedient
      to a call from Cheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triumph after triumph was displayed, and after listening gravely and
      graciously to our assurances that already everything was &ldquo;more
      better&rsquo;n Pine Creek last year,&rdquo; Cheon allowed us a glimpse of
      the pudding through a cloud of steam, the company standing reverently
      around the fire trench in a circle, as it bent over the bubbling boiler;
      then scuttling away before us like an old hen with a following of
      chickens, he led the way to the water-bags, and asked our opinion on the
      hop-beer: &ldquo;You think him jump-up longa dinner time? Eh, boss?&rdquo;
      he said anxiously, as the M&#259;luka, holding a bottle between us and the
      light, examined it critically. &ldquo;Me make him three o&rsquo;clock
      longa night-time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked remarkably still and tranquil, but we hoped for the best, and
      half an hour later were back at the water-bags, called thither to decide
      whether certain little globules were sediment or air-bubbles. Being
      sanguine, we decided in favour of bubbles, and in another half-hour were
      called back again to the bags to see that the bubbles were bubbles indeed,
      having dropped in at the kitchens on our way to give an opinion on veal
      stuffing and bread sauce; and within another half-hour were peering into
      the oven to inspect further triumphs of cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the morning passed quickly and merrily, any time Cheon left us
      being spent in making our personal appearance worthy of the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scissors and hand-glasses were borrowed, and hair cut, and chins shaved,
      until we feared our Christmas guests would look like convicts. Then the
      Dandy producing blacking brushes, boots that had never seen blacking
      before, shone like ebony. After that a mighty washing of hands took place,
      to remove the blacking stain; and then the Quarters settled down to a
      general &ldquo;titivation,&rdquo; Tam &ldquo;cleaning his nails for
      Christmas,&rdquo; amid great applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven o&rsquo;clock the Dandy was immaculate, the guests satisfied
      that they &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t too dusty,&rdquo; while the M&#259;luka, in
      spotless white relieved with a silk cummerbund and tie, bid fair to outdo
      the Dandy. Even the Quiet Stockman had succeeded in making a soft white
      shirt &ldquo;look as though it had been ironed once.&rdquo; And then every
      lubra being radiant with soap, new dresses, and ribbons, the missus,
      determined not be to outdone in the matter of Christmas finery, burrowed
      into trunks and boxes, and appeared in cream washing silk, lace fichu,
      ribbons, rings, and frivolities&mdash;finery, by the way, packed down
      south for that &ldquo;commodious station home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheon was enraptured with the appearance of his company, and worked, and
      slaved, and chuckled in the kitchen as only Cheon could, until at last the
      critical moment had arrived. Dinner was ready, but an unforeseen
      difficulty had presented itself. How was it to be announced, Cheon
      queried, having called the missus to the kitchen for a hasty consultation,
      for was it wise to puff up the Quarters with a chanted summons?
    </p>
    <p>
      A compromise being decided on as the only possible course, after the
      booming teamster&rsquo;s bell had summoned the Quarters, Cheon, all in
      white himself, bustled across to the verandah to call the gentry to the
      dinner by word of mouth:&mdash;&ldquo;Dinner! Boss! Missus!&rdquo; he sang&mdash;careful
      to specify his gentry, for not even reflected glory was to be shed over
      the Quarters. Then, moving in and out among the greenery as he put
      finishing touches to the table here and there, he glided into the wonders
      of his Christmas menu: &ldquo;Soo-oup! Chuckie! Ha-am! Roo-oast Veal-er!&rdquo;
      he chanted. &ldquo;Cauli-flower! Pee-es! Bee-ens! Toe-ma-toes!&rdquo;
      (with a regretful &ldquo;tinned&rdquo; in parenthesis)&mdash;&ldquo;Shweet
      Poo-tay-toes! Bread Sau-ce!&rdquo; On and on through mince pies, sweets,
      cakes, and fruits, went the monotonous chant, the M&#259;luka and the
      missus standing gravely at attention, until a triumphant paeon of &ldquo;Plum-m-m
      Poo-dinn!&rdquo; soared upwards as Cheon waddled off through the decorated
      verandah extension for his soup tureen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a sudden, unaccountable shyness had come over the Quarters, and as
      Cheon trundled away, a hurried argument reached our ears of &ldquo;Go on!
      You go first!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, you. Here! none of that&rdquo;; and then,
      after a short subdued scuffle, the Dandy, looking slightly dishevelled,
      came through the doorway with just the suspicion of assistance from
      within; and the ice being thus broken the rest of the company came forward
      in a body and slipped into whichever seat came handiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As all of us, with the exception of the Dandy, were Scotch, four of us
      being Macs, the M&#259;luka chose our Christmas grace from Bobby Burns;
      and quietly and reverently our Scotch hearts listened to those homely
      words:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      &ldquo;Some ha&rsquo;e meat, and canna eat,<br /> And some wad eat that
      want it;<br /> But we ha&rsquo;e meat, and we can eat,<br /> And so the Lord
      be thankit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Cheon&rsquo;s turn, and gradually and cleverly his triumphs were
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, we were served to clear soup&mdash;&ldquo;just to tickle
      your palates,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka announced, as Cheon in a hoarse
      whisper instructed him to serve &ldquo;little-fellow-helps&rdquo; anxious
      that none of the keenness should be taken from our appetites. All served,
      the tureen was whisked away to ensure against further inroads, and then
      Cheon trundled round the table, removing the soup plates, inquiring of
      each guest in turn if he found the soup to his liking, and informing all
      that lubras were on guard in the kitchen, lest the station cats should so
      far forget themselves as to take an unlawful interest in our dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soup finished with, Cheon disappeared into the kitchen regions, to
      reappear almost immediately at the head of a procession of lubras, each of
      whom carried a <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> to the feast: Jimmy&rsquo;s
      Nellie leading with the six pullets on one great dish, while Bett-Bett
      brought up the rear with the bread sauce. On through a vista of boughs and
      mistletoe came the triumphs&mdash;how glad we were the way had been made
      more worthy of their progress&mdash;the lubras, of course, were with them,
      but we had eyes only for the triumphs: Those pullets all a-row with plump
      brown breasts bursting with impatience to reveal the snowy flesh within;
      marching behind them that great sizzling &ldquo;haunch&rdquo; of veal,
      taxing Rosy&rsquo;s strength to the utmost; then Mine Host&rsquo;s crisply
      crumbed ham trudging along, and filling Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie with
      delight, with its tightly bunched little wreath of mistletoe usurping the
      place of the orthodox paper frill; behind again vegetable dishes two
      abreast, borne by the lesser lights of the staff (lids off, of course:
      none of our glory was to be hidden under covers); tailing along with the
      rejected and gravy boats came laden soup-plates to eke out the supply of
      vegetable dishes; and, last of all, that creamy delight of bread sauce,
      borne sedately and demurely by Bett-Bett.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the triumphs ranged themselves into a semi-circle at the head of the
      table, our first impulse was to cheer, but obeying a second impulse we did
      something infinitely better, for, as Cheon relieved his grinning
      waitresses, we assured him collectively, and individually, and repeatedly
      that never had any one seen anything in Pine Creek so glorious as even the
      dimmest shadow of this feast; and as we reiterated our assurance, I doubt
      if any man in all the British Empire was prouder or more justified in his
      pride than our Cheon. Cook and gardener forsooth! Cheon was Cheon, and
      only Cheon; and there is no word in the English language to define Cheon
      or the position he filled, simply because there was never another like
      Cheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuckie!&rdquo; he sang, placing the pullets before the M&#259;luka,
      and dispatching Jimmy&rsquo;s Nellie for hot plates; &ldquo;Roast Vealer
      for Mac,&rdquo; and as Mac smiled and acknowledged the honour, Rosy was
      dismissed. &ldquo;Boilee Ham&rdquo; was allotted to the Dandy; and as
      Bertie&rsquo;s Nellie scampered away, Cheon announced other triumphs in
      turn and in order of merit, each of the company receiving a dish also in
      order of merit: Tam-o&rsquo;-Shanter contenting himself with the gravy
      boat, while, from the beginning, the Quiet Stockman had been honoured with
      the hop-beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the last waitress was relieved, the carvers were at work, and
      the company was bubbling over with merriment. &ldquo;Have some veal,
      chaps?&rdquo; the Sanguine Scot said, opening the ball by sticking a
      carving fork into the great joint, and waving the knife in a general way
      round the company; then as the gravy sizzed out in a steaming gurgle he
      added invitingly: &ldquo;Come on, chaps! This is&nbsp;<i>Veal&nbsp;</i>prime
      stuff! None of your staggering Bob tack&rdquo;; and the M&#259;luka and
      the Dandy bidding against him, to Cheon&rsquo;s delight, every one &ldquo;came
      on&rdquo; for some of everything; for veal and ham and chicken and several
      vegetables and sauces blend wonderfully together when a Cheon&rsquo;s hand
      has been at the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The higher the plates were piled the more infectious Cheon&rsquo;s chuckle
      became, until nothing short of a national calamity could have checked our
      flow of spirits. Mishaps only added to our enjoyment, and when a bottle of
      hop-beer went off unexpectedly as the Quiet Stockman was preparing to open
      it, and he, with the best intentions in the world, planted his thumb over
      the mouth of the bottle, and directed two frothing streams over himself
      and the company in general, the delight of every one was unbounded&mdash;a
      delight intensified a hundredfold by Cheon, who, with his last doubt
      removed, danced and gurgled in the background, chuckling in an ecstasy of
      joy: &ldquo;My word, missus! That one beer&nbsp;<i>plenty&nbsp;</i>jump
      up!&rdquo; As there were no carpets to spoil, and every one&rsquo;s
      clothes had been washed again and again, no one&rsquo;s temper was
      spoiled, and a clean towel quickly repairing all damages, our only regret
      was that a bottle of beer had been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the plum-pudding was yet to come, and only Cheon was worthy to carry
      it to the feast; and as he came through the leafy way, bearing the huge
      mottled ball, as big as a bullock&rsquo;s head&mdash;all ablaze with
      spirits and dancing light and crowned with mistletoe&mdash;it would have
      been difficult to say which looked most pleased with itself, Cheon or the
      pudding; for each seemed wreathed in triumphant smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We held our breaths in astonishment, each feeling like the entire Cratchit
      family rolled into one, and by the time we had recovered speech, Cheon was
      soberly carrying one third of the pudding to the missus. The M&#259;luka
      had put it aside on a plate to simplify the serving of the pudding, and
      Cheon, sure that the M&#259;luka could mean such a goodly slice for no one
      but the missus, had carried it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were to be no &ldquo;little-fellow helps&rdquo; this time. Cheon saw
      to that, returning the goodly slice to the M&#259;luka under protest, and
      urging all to return again and again for more. How he chuckled as we
      hunted for the &ldquo;luck&rdquo; and the &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; like a
      parcel of children, passing round bushman jokes as we hunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much country to work,&rdquo; said one of the Macs, when after a
      second helping they were both still &ldquo;missing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Covered
      their tracks all right,&rdquo; said another. The Quiet Stockman &ldquo;reckoned
      they were bushed all right.&rdquo; &ldquo;Going in a circle,&rdquo; the
      sick Mac suggested, and then a shout went up as the Dandy found the
      &ldquo;luck&rdquo; in his last mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps some one&rsquo;s given the &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; to his dog,&rdquo;
      Tam suggested, to our consternation; for that was more than possible, as
      the dogs from time to time had received tit-bits from their masters as a
      matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man who deserved it most was to find it. As we sat sipping tea,
      after doing our best with the cakes and water-melons, we heard strange
      gurgles in the kitchen, and then Cheon appeared choking and coughing, but
      triumphantly announcing that <i>he</i> had found the wealth in his first
      mouthful. &ldquo;My word! Me close up gobble him,&rdquo; he chuckled,
      exhibiting the pudding-coated threepence, and not one of us grudged him
      his good omens. May they have been fulfilled a thousand-fold!
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly our Christmas dinner was a huge success&mdash;from a black
      fellow&rsquo;s point of view it was the most sensible thing we Whites had
      ever organised; for half the Vealer, another huge pudding, several yards
      of sweet currant &ldquo;brownie,&rsquo;&rdquo; a new pipe apiece, and a
      few pounds of tobacco had found their way to the &ldquo;humpy&rdquo;; and
      although headaches may have been in the near future, there was never a
      heartache among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon we sat and chatted as only the bush-folk can (the bush-folk
      are only silent when in uncongenial society), &ldquo;putting in&rdquo; a
      fair amount of time writing our names on one page of an autograph album;
      and as strong brown hands tried their utmost to honour Christmas day with
      something decent in the way of writing, each man declared that he had
      never written so badly before, while the company murmured: &ldquo;Oh, <i>yours</i>
      is all right. Look at mine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, however, was the exception; for when his turn came, with quiet
      humour he &ldquo;thought that on the whole his was a bit better&rsquo;n
      last Christmas,&rdquo; which naturally set us discussing the advantages of
      learning; but when we all agreed &ldquo;it would be a bit off having to
      employ a private secretary when you were doing a bit of courting,&rdquo;
      Jack hastened to assure us that &ldquo;courting&rdquo; would never be in
      <i>his</i> line&mdash;coming events do not always throw shadows before
      them. Thus from &ldquo;learning&rdquo; we slipped into &ldquo;courtship&rdquo;
      and marriage, and on into life&mdash;life and its problems&mdash;and,
      chatting, agreed that, in spite of, or perhaps&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;</i>of,
      its many acknowledged disadvantages, the simple, primitive bush-life is
      the sweetest and best of all&mdash;sure that although there may have been
      more imposing or less unconventional feasts elsewhere that Christmas day,
      yet nowhere in all this old round world of ours could there have been a
      happier, merrier, healthier-hearted gathering. No one was bored. No one
      wished himself elsewhere. All were sure of their welcome. All were
      light-hearted and at ease; although no one so far forgot himself as to
      pour his hop-beer into the saucer in a lady&rsquo;s presence, for, low be
      it spoken, although the missus had a glass tumbler, there were only two on
      the run, and the men-folk drank the Christmas healths from cups, and
      enamel at that; for a Willy-Willy had taken Cheon unaware when he was
      laden with a tray containing every glass and china cup fate had left us,
      and, as by a miracle, those two glasses had been saved from the wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But enamel cups were no hardships to the bush-folk, and besides, nothing
      inconvenienced us that day&mdash;excepting perhaps doing justice to
      further triumphs at afternoon tea; and all we had to wish for was the
      company of Dan and the Fizzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to the general comfort, a gentle north-west breeze blew all through
      the day, besides being what Bett-Bett called a &ldquo;shady day,&rdquo;
      cloudy and cool; and to add to the general rejoicing, before we had quite
      done with &ldquo;Clisymus&rdquo; an extra mail came in per black boy&mdash;a
      mail sent out to us by the &ldquo;courtesy of our officers&rdquo; at the
      Katherine, &ldquo;seeing some of the packages felt like Christmas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to us on the verandah. Two very full Mailbags borne by two very
      empty black boys, and in an incredibly short space of time there were two
      very full black boys, and two very empty mail-bags; for the mail was our
      delayed mail, and exactly what we wanted; and the boys had found all they
      wanted at Cheon&rsquo;s hospitable hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even Christmas days must come to an end; and as the sun slipped down
      to the west, Mac and Tam &ldquo;reckoned it was time to be getting a move
      on&rdquo;; and as they mounted amid further Christmas wishes, with
      saddle-pouches bursting with offerings from Cheon for &ldquo;Clisymus
      supper,&rdquo; a strange feeling of sadness crept in among us, and we
      wondered where &ldquo;we would all be next Christmas.&rdquo; Then our
      Christmas guests rode out into the forest, taking with them the sick Mac,
      and as they faded from our sight we knew that the memory of that Christmas
      day would never fade out of our lives; for we bush-folk have long memories
      and love to rest now and then beside the milestones of the past.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter24" id="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Day or two after Christmas, Dan came in full of regrets because he had
      &ldquo;missed the celebrations,&rdquo; and gratified Cheon&rsquo;s heart
      with a minute and detailed account of the &ldquo;Clisymus&rdquo; at Pine
      Creek. Then the homestead settled down to the stagnation of the Wet, and
      as the days and weeks slipped by, travellers came in and went on, and Mac
      and Tam paid us many visits, as with the weeks we slipped through a
      succession of anniversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year to-day, Mac, since you sent those telegrams!&rdquo; we said,
      near the beginning of those weeks; and, all mock gravity, Mac answered
      &ldquo;Yes! And blocked that Goer!... Often wondered what happened to her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year to-day, gentlemen,&rdquo; I added a few days later, &ldquo;since
      you flung that woman across the Fergusson&rdquo;; and as Mac enjoyed the
      reminiscence, the M&#259;luka said: &ldquo;And forgot to fling the false
      veneer of civilisation after her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later again we were greeting Tam at the homestead. &ldquo;Just
      a year ago, Tam,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;you were...&rdquo; but Tam&rsquo;s
      horse was young and untutored, and, getting out of hand, carried Tam away
      beyond the buildings. &ldquo;A Tam-o&rsquo;-Shanter fleeing,&rdquo; the M&#259;luka
      once more murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dan filled in the days, until one evening just at sundown, when we
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year this sundown, Dan, since we first sampled one of your
      dampers,&rdquo; and, chuckling, Dan reviewed the details of that camp, and
      slipped thence into reviewing education. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s learned a
      thing or two since then,&rdquo; he chuckled: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t notice
      people catching cows and milking &rsquo;em round these parts quite so
      often.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning came the Quiet Stockman&rsquo;s turn. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a little brown filly in the mob I&rsquo;m just beginning on, cut out for
      the missus,&rdquo; he said, coming to the house on his way to the
      stockyard, and we went with him to see the bonnie creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sort that&rsquo;ll learn anything,&rdquo; Jack
      said, his voice full of admiration. &ldquo;If the missus&rsquo;ll handle
      her a bit, I&rsquo;ll learn her everything a horse can learn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gypsy&rdquo; he had named her, and in a little while the pretty
      creature was &ldquo;roped&rdquo; and standing quietly beneath Jack&rsquo;s
      caressing hand. &ldquo;Now, missus,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and then followed
      my first lesson in &ldquo;handling,&rdquo; until the soft brown muzzle was
      resting contentedly in my hand. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon follow you,&rdquo;
      Jack said eagerly, &ldquo;you ought to come up every day&rdquo;; and
      looking up at the glowing, boyish face, I said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a year to-day, Jack, since you met us by the roadside,&rdquo;
      and the strong young giant looked down with an amused light in his eyes.
      &ldquo;Just a year,&rdquo; he said, with that quiet smile of his; and that
      quiet smile, and that amused &ldquo;Just a year&rdquo; were more eloquent
      than volumes of words, and set Dan &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo; that somebody
      else&rsquo;s been learning a thing or two besides book learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Dandy was waiting for some tools from the office, and as we went
      with him he, too, spoke of the anniversaries. &ldquo;Just a year since you
      first put foot on this verandah,&rdquo; he said, and that reminiscence
      brought into the M&#259;luka&rsquo;s eyes that deep look of bush
      comradeship, as he added: &ldquo;And became just One of Us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long Mac was reminding us that a year ago she was wrestling with
      the servant question, and Cheon coming by, we indulged in a negative
      anniversary. &ldquo;A year ago, Cheon,&rdquo; we said &ldquo;there was no
      Cheon in our lives,&rdquo; and Cheon pitied our former forlorn condition
      as only Cheon could, at the same time asking us what could be expected of
      one of Sam&rsquo;s ways and caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then other anniversaries crowded on us thick and fast, and with them there
      crept into the Territory that scourge of the wet season&mdash;malarial
      dysentery, and travellers coming in stricken-down with it rested a little
      while before going on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two of these sick travellers went down to the very gates of death,
      where one, a little Chinaman, slipped through, blessing the &ldquo;good
      boss,&rdquo; who treated all men alike, and leaving an echo of the
      blessing in old Cheon&rsquo;s loyal heart. But the other sick traveller
      turned back from those open gates, although bowed with the weight of
      seventy years, and faced life anew, blessing in his turn &ldquo;the
      whitest man&rdquo; those seventy years had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bravely the worn, bowed shoulders took up the burden of life again, and,
      as they squared to their load, we slipped back to our anniversaries&mdash;once
      more Jack went bush for the schooling of his colts, once more Mac and Dan
      went into the Katherine to &ldquo;see about the ordering of stores,&rdquo;
      Tam going with them; and as they rode out of the homestead, once more we
      slipped, with the Dandy, into the Land of Wait-a-while&mdash;waiting once
      more for the wet to lift, for the waggons to come, and for the Territory
      to rouse itself for another year&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of bright hopes, we rested in that Land of Wait-a-while, speaking of
      the years to come, when the bush-folk will have conquered the Never-Never
      and lain it at the feet of great cities; and, waiting and resting, made
      merry and planned plans, all unconscious of the great shadow that was even
      then hovering over us.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <b><a name="Chapter25AndLast" id="Chapter25AndLast"></a>Chapter 25 And
      Last</b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is little more to tell. Just that old, old story&mdash;that sad
      refrain of the Kaffir woman that we British-born can conquer anything but
      Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      All unaware, that scourge of the Wet crept back to the homestead, and the
      great Shadow, closing in on us, flung wide those gates of Death once more,
      and turning, before passing through, beckoned to our M&#259;luka to
      follow. But at those open gates the M&#259;luka lingered a little while
      with those who were fighting so fiercely and impotently to close them&mdash;lingering
      to teach us out of his own great faith that &ldquo;Behind all Shadows
      standeth God.&rdquo; And then the gates gently closing, a woman stood
      alone in that little home that had been wrested, so merrily, out of the
      very heart of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is all the world need know. All else lies deep in the silent hearts
      of the Men of the Never-Never,&mdash;in those great, silent hearts that
      came in to the woman at her need; came in at the Dandy&rsquo;s call, and
      went out to her, and shut her in from all the dangers and terror that
      beset her, quietly mourning their own loss the while. And as those great
      hearts mourned, ever and anon a long-drawn-out, sobbing cry went up from
      the camp, as the tribe mourned for their beloved dead&mdash;their dead and
      ours&mdash;our M&#259;luka, &ldquo;the best Boss that ever a man struck.&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
