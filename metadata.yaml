description: "We of the Never Never is an autobiographical novel by Jeannie Gunn.\
  \ Although published as a novel, it is an account of the author's experiences in\
  \ 1902 at Elsey Station near Mataranka, Northern Territory in which she changed\
  \ the names of people to obscure their identities. She published this book under\
  \ the name Mrs Aeneas Gunn, using her husband's first and last name. Over the years\
  \ newspapers and magazine articles chronicled the fortunes of the Elsey characters:\
  \ Jeannie outlived all but Bett-Bett.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
